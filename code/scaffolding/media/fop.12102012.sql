The pilots then begins to pull up, gradually increasing the angle of the aircraft to about 45 deg to the horizon reaching an altitude of 34,000 feet. During this pull-up, passengers will feel the pull of 1.8 g. Next the plane is “pushed over” to create the zero gravity segment of the parabola. For the next 20-30 seconds everything in the plane is weightless. Next a gentle pull-out is started which allows the flyers to stabilize on the aircraft floor. This maneuver is repeated 30-40 times, each taking about ten miles of airspace to perform.</p>\r\n'),(360,'\r\n  <p style=\"font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-weight: bold;\">PAYLOAD CONFIGURATION</p>\r\n  <p>Approximately 20m (67ft) of cabin length is available for test purposes.

The flights will include manned and unmanned missions.\r\n\r\nThe contracts are worth a combined total of $10 million, and the flights will carry a diverse mix of payloads to meet the agency\'s research and technology needs, NASA officials said in a statement.\r\n		</p></div>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"news_wrapper\">\r\n    <p class=\"grid_2 alpha news_date\">July 28, 2011</p>\r\n		<div class=\"grid_10 omega\">\r\n			<p>\r\n			  <a class=\"bold\" href=\"http://www.technewsdaily.com/3d-printers-create-tools-in-space-3049/\">3-D Printers to Create Tools in Orbit</a>\r\n        <span class=\"magz\">by <a href=\"http://www.technewsdaily.com\">TechNewsDaily</a></span>\r\n			</p><p>3-D printers that could crank out parts for spacecraft and space stations – from wrenches to screws – all while in orbit is becoming one step closer to reality.\r\n\r\nA company called Made in Space has completed a successful testing period of two 3-D printers on multiple NASA flights, with a scaled-down wrench becoming the first-ever tool printed in partial zero gravity.\r\n\r\nPrinting out parts in space could eventually be transplanted to other worlds such as the moon, where it could help human colonies gain a foothold by printing out robot parts or buildings, piece by piece.\r\n		</p></div>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"news_wrapper\">\r\n    <p class=\"grid_2 alpha news_date\">July 7, 2011</p>\r\n		<div class=\"grid_10 omega\">\r\n			<p>\r\n			  <a class=\"bold\" href=\"http://www.space.com/12197-commercial-suborbital-spacecraft-science-research.html\">Private Suborbital Spaceships to Launch Sky-High Research</a>\r\n        <span class=\"magz\">by <a href=\"http://www.space.com\">SPACE.com</a></span>\r\n			</p><p>Private entrepreneurial rocket firms are throttling up efforts to create a new breed of reusable hardware capable of hauling payloads to the edge of space and returning them softly to solid ground.\r\n\r\nThe work is being backed by NASA\'s Flight Opportunities Program, an initiative that recently united the agency\'s Facilitated Access to the Space environment for Technology (FAST) program and its Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research (CRuSR) program.\r\n		</p></div>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"news_wrapper\">\r\n    <p class=\"grid_2 alpha news_date\">May 16, 2011</p>\r\n		<div class=\"grid_10 omega\">\r\n			<p>\r\n			  <a class=\"bold\" href=\"http://www.commercialspaceflight.org/?p=1529\">NASA Announces Its First Payloads for Commercial Suborbital Spacecraft; NASA Office of Chief Technologist Pursuing High-Payoff Projects</a>\r\n        <span class=\"magz\">by <a href=\"http://www.commercialspaceflight.org\">Commercial Spaceflight Federation</a></span>\r\n			</p><p>Washington, D.C. – NASA has announced its first four payloads to fly on commercial suborbital spacecraft, kicking off a new era of low-cost technology R&amp;D, science, and STEM education enabled by new commercial spacecraft being developed by Armadillo Aerospace, Blue Origin, Masten Space Systems, Virgin Galactic, and XCOR Aerospace.

During our first day we \r\nperformed preliminary tests and later that day did some trouble-shooting\r\n to improve measurements. Our second day was almost perfect. We achieved\r\n 90% of the test requirements and we were on our way to achieve 100% on \r\nthe 3rd and 4th days. We will have to run some tests at 1g to determine \r\nthe effect of lower g\'s, but from the first impression it looks like \r\nlower gravity does have a positive effect on the efficiency of pneumatic\r\n soil transfer. Having this two-day experience of reduced-g flights, we \r\nare now much more experienced and know exactly how to prepare ourselves \r\nand experiments for the next flights.<br />Kris Zacny<br />Honeybee \r\nRobotics, New York, NY<br /><br />Nanofluid Coolant Testing<br />During our \r\nsecond flight we obtained high quality data that showed that the thermal\r\n conductivity of nanofluids remained high at all gravity conditions \r\nmeasured. This was the validation that we were looking for and will \r\nincrease the technology readiness level of our technology.<br />Steven \r\nOldenburg<br />nanoComposix, Inc., San Diego, CA<br /><br />Microgravity \r\nFlight-testing of Self-deploying Shells<br />During one day of testing, \r\nMevicon Inc. measured the deployment of about 25 different roll stowed \r\nshells in various gravity conditions. Parameters such as shell \r\nprescription, material, and repeatability were assessed. The data, when \r\ncompared to ground test results for similar shells, will help us refine \r\nmodels by including the effect of the absence of gravity on our membrane\r\n shell deployment, thereby preparing the way for their potential use in \r\nspace applications. It was also seen that 0.3m shells maintained their \r\nshape even when fully deployed in the 2-G environment.<br /><br />We thought\r\n both the Zero-G folks and the NASA folks were very professional and \r\nhelpful. If we get the chance to fly again, we would really welcome \r\nthat. Now that Jim and Travis were actually in the microgravity \r\nenvironment we have already envisaged relatively minor changes to the \r\ntest approach that would enhance throughput.<br />Eric Flint<br />Mevicon \r\nInc., Sunnyvale, CA<br /><br />Virtual Sensor Test Instrumentation \r\nOperations<br />The experience is exciting and helping us tremendously to \r\nconfirm the operation capabilities of the smart sensors.

NASA needs to review many concepts and technologies. Having a standard summary page which emphasizes the technical context of an idea is useful and helps NASA to review of many ideas quickly and efficiently. The Penta Chart format asks that a technology be described in terms of the problem/need it addresses and asks for a summary of the status quo in how the problem is addressed today. In the introduction and description of the idea, the Penta Chart asks for a description of the insight achieved which make this idea attractive. The proposer is asked to provide a description of the concept along with a summary of the benefits of its approach. If a development program is pursued, the Penta Chart format asks for the goals that would be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quad Chart</strong>: the Quad Chart format is a traditional one page summary of a project. A Quad Chart asks for a brief description of the project, a statement about the potential benefit from the project, and description of the management approach of the project, and a summary of the cost and schedule for the project.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Suborbital Rocket</strong>: a vehicle, rocket-propelled in whole or in part, intended for flight on a suborbital trajectory, and the thrust of which is greater than its lift for the majority of the rocket-powered portion of its ascent. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Suborbital Trajectory</strong>: the intentional flight path of a launch vehicle, reentry vehicle, or any portion thereof, whose vacuum instantaneous impact point does not leave the surface of the Earth. </p><p><strong>Key Decision Point (KDP)</strong>:  the event at which the Decision Authority determines the readiness of a program/project to progress to the next phase of the life cycle (or to the next KDP). </p><p><strong>Guided technology</strong>:  technology that meet high value strategic goals and critical needs</p><p><strong>Proof of Concept</strong>:  Analytical and experimental demonstration of hardware/software concepts that may or may not be incorporated into subsequent development and/or operational units. </p><p><strong>Breadboard</strong>: A low fidelity unit that demonstrates function only, without respect to form or fit in the case of hardware, or platform in the case of software. It often uses commercial and/or ad hoc components and is not intended to provide definitive information regarding operational performance. </p><p><strong>Brassboard</strong>:  A medium fidelity functional unit that typically tries to make use of as much operational hardware/software as possible and begins to address scaling issues associated with the operational system. It does not have the engineering pedigree in all aspects, but is structured to be able to operate in simulated operational environments in order to assess performance of critical functions. </p><p><strong>Proto-type Unit</strong>:  The proto-type unit demonstrates form, fit, and function at a scale deemed to be representative of the final product operating in its operational environment. A subscale test article provides fidelity sufficient to permit validation of analytical models capable of predicting the behavior of full-scale systems in an operational environment </p><p><strong>Engineering Unit</strong>:  A high fidelity unit that demonstrates critical aspects of the engineering processes involved in the development of the operational unit. Engineering test units are intended to closely resemble the final product (hardware/software) to the maximum extent possible and are built and tested so as to establish confidence that the design will function in the expected environments. In some cases, the engineering unit will become the final product, assuming proper traceability has been exercised over the components and hardware handling. </p><p><strong>Mission Configuration</strong>:  The final architecture/system design of the product that will be used in the operational environment. If the product is a subsystem/component, then it is embedded in the actual system in the actual configuration used in operation. </p><p><strong>Laboratory Environment:</strong>  An environment that does not address in any manner the environment to be encountered by the system, subsystem, or component (hardware or software) during its intended operation. Tests in a laboratory environment are solely for the purpose of demonstrating the underlying principles of technical performance (functions), without respect to the impact of environment. </p><p><strong>Relevant Environment</strong>:  Not all systems, subsystems, and/or components need to be operated in the operational environment in order to satisfactorily address performance margin requirements. Consequently, the relevant environment is the specific subset of the operational environment that is required to demonstrate critical \"at risk\" aspects of the final product performance in an operational environment. It is an environment that focuses specifically on \"stressing\" the technology advance in question. </p><p><strong>Operational Environment</strong>:  The environment in which the final product will be operated. In the case of space flight hardware/software, it is space. In the case of ground-based or airborne systems that are not directed toward space flight, it will be the environments defined by the scope of operations. For software, the environment will be defined by the operational platform.</p>\r\n'),(527,'<h2>Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Descriptions</h2>'),(528,'<table>\r\n\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <th>TRL</th>\r\n  <th>Definition</th>\r\n  <th>Hardware Description</th>\r\n<th>Software Description</th>\r\n<th>Exit Criteria</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBasic principles observed and reported. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nScientific knowledge generated underpinning hardware technology concepts/applications. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nScientific knowledge generated underpinning basic properties of software architecture and mathematical formulation. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nPeer reviewed publication of research underlying the proposed concept/application.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2</td>\r\n<td>\r\nTechnology concept and/or application formulated. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nInvention begins, practical application is identified but is speculative, no experimental proof or detailed analysis is available to support the conjecture. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nPractical application is identified but is speculative, no experimental proof or detailed analysis is available to support the conjecture.

This enhances the ability to overfly specific targets or fly desired profiles. The Shuttle semi-autonomously returns payloads to pre-specified landing sites, and, with benign landing conditions, allows payloads to be rapidly turned around and reused in re-flights.

NASA needs to review many concepts and technologies. Having a standard summary page which emphasizes the technical context of an idea is useful and helps NASA to review of many ideas quickly and efficiently. The Penta Chart format asks that a technology be described in terms of the problem/need it addresses and asks for a summary of the status quo in how the problem is addressed today. In the introduction and description of the idea, the Penta Chart asks for a description of the insight achieved which make this idea attractive. The proposer is asked to provide a description of the concept along with a summary of the benefits of its approach. If a development program is pursued, the Penta Chart format asks for the goals that would be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quad Chart</strong>: the Quad Chart format is a traditional one page summary of a project. A Quad Chart asks for a brief description of the project, a statement about the potential benefit from the project, and description of the management approach of the project, and a summary of the cost and schedule for the project.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Suborbital Rocket</strong>: a vehicle, rocket-propelled in whole or in part, intended for flight on a suborbital trajectory, and the thrust of which is greater than its lift for the majority of the rocket-powered portion of its ascent. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Suborbital Trajectory</strong>: the intentional flight path of a launch vehicle, reentry vehicle, or any portion thereof, whose vacuum instantaneous impact point does not leave the surface of the Earth. </p><p><strong>Key Decision Point (KDP)</strong>:  the event at which the Decision Authority determines the readiness of a program/project to progress to the next phase of the life cycle (or to the next KDP). </p><p><strong>Guided technology</strong>:  technology that meet high value strategic goals and critical needs</p><p><strong>Proof of Concept</strong>:  Analytical and experimental demonstration of hardware/software concepts that may or may not be incorporated into subsequent development and/or operational units. </p><p><strong>Breadboard</strong>: A low fidelity unit that demonstrates function only, without respect to form or fit in the case of hardware, or platform in the case of software. It often uses commercial and/or ad hoc components and is not intended to provide definitive information regarding operational performance. </p><p><strong>Brassboard</strong>:  A medium fidelity functional unit that typically tries to make use of as much operational hardware/software as possible and begins to address scaling issues associated with the operational system. It does not have the engineering pedigree in all aspects, but is structured to be able to operate in simulated operational environments in order to assess performance of critical functions. </p><p><strong>Proto-type Unit</strong>:  The proto-type unit demonstrates form, fit, and function at a scale deemed to be representative of the final product operating in its operational environment. A subscale test article provides fidelity sufficient to permit validation of analytical models capable of predicting the behavior of full-scale systems in an operational environment </p><p><strong>Engineering Unit</strong>:  A high fidelity unit that demonstrates critical aspects of the engineering processes involved in the development of the operational unit. Engineering test units are intended to closely resemble the final product (hardware/software) to the maximum extent possible and are built and tested so as to establish confidence that the design will function in the expected environments. In some cases, the engineering unit will become the final product, assuming proper traceability has been exercised over the components and hardware handling. </p><p><strong>Mission Configuration</strong>:  The final architecture/system design of the product that will be used in the operational environment. If the product is a subsystem/component, then it is embedded in the actual system in the actual configuration used in operation. </p><p><strong>Laboratory Environment:</strong>  An environment that does not address in any manner the environment to be encountered by the system, subsystem, or component (hardware or software) during its intended operation. Tests in a laboratory environment are solely for the purpose of demonstrating the underlying principles of technical performance (functions), without respect to the impact of environment. </p><p><strong>Relevant Environment</strong>:  Not all systems, subsystems, and/or components need to be operated in the operational environment in order to satisfactorily address performance margin requirements. Consequently, the relevant environment is the specific subset of the operational environment that is required to demonstrate critical \"at risk\" aspects of the final product performance in an operational environment. It is an environment that focuses specifically on \"stressing\" the technology advance in question. </p><p><strong>Operational Environment</strong>:  The environment in which the final product will be operated. In the case of space flight hardware/software, it is space. In the case of ground-based or airborne systems that are not directed toward space flight, it will be the environments defined by the scope of operations. For software, the environment will be defined by the operational platform.</p>\r\n'),(942,'<h2>Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Descriptions</h2>'),(943,'<table>\r\n\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <th>TRL</th>\r\n  <th>Definition</th>\r\n  <th>Hardware Description</th>\r\n<th>Software Description</th>\r\n<th>Exit Criteria</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1</td>\r\n<td>\r\nBasic principles observed and reported. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nScientific knowledge generated underpinning hardware technology concepts/applications. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nScientific knowledge generated underpinning basic properties of software architecture and mathematical formulation. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nPeer reviewed publication of research underlying the proposed concept/application.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2</td>\r\n<td>\r\nTechnology concept and/or application formulated. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nInvention begins, practical application is identified but is speculative, no experimental proof or detailed analysis is available to support the conjecture. \r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nPractical application is identified but is speculative, no experimental proof or detailed analysis is available to support the conjecture.

The database of simulated eigenmode frequencies is created in advance using RF simulation software to calculate the tank eigenmodes at various fill levels and liquid configurations. A best match between the simulated and measured frequency values occurs at some fill level, which is then reported as the gauged fill level.

The secondary objective of this flight is to test the functionality of the newly automated parts of this apparatus.','A prototype of this equipment was developed and tested in flight as a part of the NASA Systems Engineering Educational Discovery (SEED) program in NASA’s Microgravity University in the fall of 2009. In the program, a group of five Yale undergraduate students worked with NASA biologist Zarana Patel to design and develop a 3-D culture apparatus that would maintain the air-liquid interface while in microgravity. In the fall of 2010, we worked to improve the design of the 3-D cell culture apparatus to eliminate the problem of air bubble formation.

After demonstration of the prototype the system could be considered TRL-6, as the component prototype would be demonstrated and operate under the relevant environment of microgravity.','This technology has the potential to benefit NASA, the US military, and the broad medical community. Advances in chest tube drainage technology can be incorporated into general medical usage after undergoing FDA review. The development of a drainage system that can function independent of orientation will be of great benefit to medical providers during any type of medical transport, civilian or military, and can be used in the aerospace or terrestrial environment.'),(27,'Long duration spaceflight poses multiple hazards to human health, including increased exposure to radiation, nutritional deficiencies, and physiological changes associated with microgravity. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of space radiation-induced initiation and progression of epithelial cell carcinomas, we are utilizing a unique three-dimensional (3-D) organotypic model (a form of human tissue engineering) that can accurately mimic many epithelial tissues. These 3-D models offer advantages over standard monolayer culture systems because they mimic the morphological features, differentiation markers, and growth characteristics of fully-differentiated normal human tissue and are reproducible using defined components. Construction of the 3-D model involves various components and cell structures. The bottom “base” layer consists of fibroblast cells mixed into an extracellular matrix of collagen I and Matrigel. These bases are then seeded on the top surface with epithelial cells and submerged in media for a defined time. At this point in culture, an air-liquid interface (ALI) is created by removing media to below the level of the epithelial cells, exposing the top layer of the base to air alone. This process triggers differentiation and stratification of the epithelial layers and allows the development of a realistic tissue-like structure. The creation of the ALI is critical to proper cell development and is a key process in this protocol. However, in a microgravity environment, the problem of maintaining an ALI becomes apparent since there will be no gravitational forces to retain the media at the bottom of the cultures and keep it from floating to the top.','We have already developed and tested a prototype of the 3-D cell culture apparatus but are still in the preliminary build phase for our second-generation design. Prior to the previous flight, the apparatus was at TRL 4; by the time of the upcoming flight, it will be between TRL 4 and 5. Flying the most recent version of the apparatus is critical to its TRL advancement. Several of the developments that allow the apparatus to operate autonomously must be tested in zero gravity before the device can advance to TRL 6, which is to develop a high fidelity system/prototype and test it in its relevant environment (0 g).','The capacity to grow and maintain 3-D organotypic cultures in microgravity will be essential for conducting fundamental life sciences research on topics addressed by the OCT Technology Area TA06. Development of a fully-automated cell culture system for microgravity will facilitate this research and dramatically increase the knowledge base required for minimizing the risks of manned spaceflight. In addition, the Human Research Program (HRP), as a part of the Advanced Capabilities Division of HEOMD, has identified areas where further research is necessary to mitigate the risks of space flight. These areas include the health effects of radiation, characteristics of the space radiation environment, and possible countermeasures and their efficacy. The 3-D organotypic model, and therefore the cell culture apparatus that we have developed to grow and maintain these models, can be utilized to directly address these and other questions.'),(20,'Two-phase flow experimental studies at partial gravities have been very limited, and primarily conducted using special aircraft modified to fly parabolas. The typical flight profile is limited to an acceleration range of near-zero to approximately 1.8-g, with reduced gravity periods of only approximately 20 to 30 seconds during each parabolic maneuver. A suborbital flight would allow longer-duration, continuous operational testing with variable gravity over a wider range, for both the unique separator concept and two-phase flow design.','The MFEST would provide the first opportunity to operate through a representative full-mission profile using a suborbital vehicle, with exposure to and testing at variable gravity levels for a duration an order of magnitude longer than in specialized aircraft. Additionally, this experiment would identify any significant hardware issues and provide correction or recommendations for this type of design, including evaluation of the separator concept for space applications. The system’s Technical Readiness Level (TRL) would advance to 6/7 as a result of this flight testing.','The passive vortex separator concept was originally developed at Texas A&M University. The University provided a license to Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT), of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to commercialize the subsequent momentum-driven vortex phase separator (MDVPS) technology. ACT specializes in advanced thermal technology development and custom thermal product manufacturing, and intends to apply the MDVPS technology to products for aerospace, military, commercial, and government research and development (R&D) customers.'),(32,'There are two mission objectives for this experiment. The first is to verify that the models and simulations of our CubeSat deployables are accurate by testing the deployables in a microgravity environment and recording inertial sensor data during deployment. The second is to verify that the deployment mechanism for each deployable operates as expected with no problems.','The testing would allow us to test a full prototype, including all of the mechanical systems, of our CubeSat in a relevant environment. As partial software integration will also be required for the testing, our TRL after the proposed testing will be 6.','The applications of this technology could be used in most CubeSats because it improves technology in power via the solar panel array, communications via the monopole antenna, and attitude stabilization via the gravity gradient boom, all of which are necessary for satellite operations.'),(33,'The prototype is developed by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) based upon a licensed design from MITRE for the UAT Beacon Radio – Transmit Only (or UBR-TX). To differentiate between the two units, the ERAU prototype for this flight opportunity will be named the UBR-ERAU. Developed under a contract with the FAA’s Commercial Space Transportation Office (AST), the UBR-ERAU upgrades the design of the UBR-TX in order to support some of the constraints of space flight. The previous design’s commercial GPS receiver has been replaced with a high-end GPS capable of supporting space velocities and altitudes (which are typically restricted under International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR)). The goal is to improve the TRL of the UBR-ERAU payload from a TRL4 to a TRL 6. This would be achieved via a flight opportunity on one of NSC’s high-altitude balloons, either the SBS or NBS. A maximum altitude is desired of at least 37 km, but at a minimum exceeding 24 km. The desired flight profile would include 30 minutes to 2 hours of total time at maximum altitude.','Once the test flight is performed, the technical readiness shall increase from TRL 4 to TRL 6 because the high-quality prototype will have been fully tested within the target operating environment. By proving that the upgrades allow the unit’s operational capabilities to exceed that of the previous model, the UBR-TX, our team will have made significant progress in moving this technology forward.','The benefits of developing the UBR-ERAU to support commercial space transportation is very compelling. It is anticipated that the developed prototype will become a standard payload on any flight of reusable launch vehicles once it has been proven robust and reliable.'),(12,'The fundamental technology to be advanced is an integrated bundle of biotechnology and spaceflight hardware instrumentation. The biotechnology consists of biosensor organisms, in this validation case Arabidopsis plants engineered with a variety of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter genes designed to report the biological response of a plant, or plant tissue, to its environment. The goal is to advance the TRL of the GFP Imaging System (GIS) such that it can be designed into a stand-alone, mission-autonomous technology that is monitored solely by telemetry and is relevant to future parabolic and suborbital opportunities for science.','Successful testing of the hardware within the parabolic flight environment immediately raises the TRL of the system to 7 or 8. After this testing, future parabolic flight experiments could then make essentially direct use of the GIS-III UFGR–level imager. The commercial suborbital environment potentially fills the gap between parabolic flights and longer term orbital deployments such as shuttle and ISS. Successful parabolic demonstration of GIS-III offers development pathways through stand-alone suborbital deployments and also through integration into suborbital platforms designed to support middeck locker volume fractions, and would raise the TRL for suborbital flights to approximately 6-7+, depending on the supporting hardware.','Although the focus is on applications to parabolic and suborbital flight platforms, insights gained here will support future applications and opportunities, including ASTID proposals, future Human Tended Suborbital calls and SALMON missions such as providing a next-generation instrument for science return from GeneSat and other related satellite missions, as well as future parabolic opportunities dedicated to science. This technology also has longer term development potential for small satellite and planetary lander applications as well, and speaks directly to aspects of the OCT Space Technology Roadmaps (Technology Area 10 Nanotechnology, with application to TA6 Life Support and Habitation Systems and TA08 Science Instruments), particularly the development sensitive, next-generation imagers that can collect data telemetrically, and in real time.'),(13,'The project\'s goal is to continuously pump DNA within a buffer/oil carrier solution into a microfluidic chip along with a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) mixture. The mixture passes through a temperature gradient PCR microchannel consisting of 40 DNA amplification cycles. Thermal cycling occurs as the mixture travels serially through the serpentine microchannel. Precise temperature regulation is thus key to the device\'s operation, necessitating the assessment of thermal control in the convectionless microgravity environment.','This project leverages research activity with university partners that are leaders in micromanufacturing (LaTech). The proposed effort will take a technology currently at TRL-5 and through the proposed testing under parabolic flight conditions elevate it to TRL-6 by demonstrating its functionality under microgravity conditions. After a cubesat/ISS flight (targeting 2014), the technology will be further elevated to TRL-7.','Commercial applications of this technology pertain to the development of miniaturized medical equipment such as diagnostic instruments used by emergency responders and personalized caregivers.'),(21,'The effects of controlled harmonic vibrations in some multiphase systems (namely, bubbly flows and granular gases) in weightlessness have been recently studied both analytically and experimentally by different research groups. These works have shown a common feature of the systems consisting of a characteristic pattern selection under certain conditions. The observed pattern consists of the alignment of the dispersed phase in thin layers or screens perpendicular to the vibration direction. This phenomenon constitutes an interesting feature which could become very useful for the management of multiphase flows in space. The most appropriate way to mature the technology towards use in its intended applications is to fly it on sounding rockets or sRLV. On the one hand, the quality of microgravity of these platforms makes them the most adequate choice to test the effects of controlled vibrations. On the other hand, we expect that the microgravity times provided by these platforms will be long enough to allow observing the steady states of the systems under consideration in each configuration.','The proposed technology is currently between TRL 3 and close to 4. The flight for which this proposal is submitted is not expected to advance the TRL since its main purpose is to test the integration of the payload with the vehicle at a low gravity environment. In order to advance the TRL, later series of flights with different configurations of the system will have to be performed. We expect that after these future flights the technology could be validated for the considered configurations in microgravity, and thus reach TRL 5.','The proposed technology has potential applications for the management of multiphase systems in different areas. In particular, an important application is found in the storage of cryogenic propellants in microgravity environments, which is a key element to enable long-range exploration missions. Bubble nucleation and growth can be of potentially hazardous nature for long-term on-orbit cryogenic fluid management operations. The control of bubbles by means of vibrations can become a mechanism to overcome this problem. Applications of the technology are not only restricted to a microgravity environment. We expect that the knowledge that will be acquired during the maturation process of the technology will allow extending its application to different gravity environments (Moon, Mars).'),(18,'The VPCAR experiment has previously flown in reduced gravity and uncovered heat transfer loss phenomenon that reduced the process efficiency; with installation of additional components this issue has been mitigated but requires further testing to resolve this issue. Researchers will advance the VPCAR technology and couple (combine) it with the existing Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMG) flywheel subsystems to enable reduction of mass, power usage and system complexity. It is anticipated that this combined system would be employed on all four CMG’s onboard the International Space Station (ISS), adding redundancy and consistency to potable water reclamation from grey water with a lower power consumption rate than is currently realized by the independently operated systems.','Having successfully flown this hardware previously currently the test readiness level (TRL) is seven (7) and with modification and after additional testing this hardware would be brought to TRL nine (9).','The resulting multi-disciplinary system has the potential of better packaging options due to reduced overall volume and built in redundancy. NASA, through its role in the International Space Station (ISS) is the prime future customer.'),(43,'The main idea behind our method is to apply an electric force directly to a fluid via capacitive coupling to external electrodes in order to eliminate the adverse effects of electro-chemical reactions at the fluid-electrode interface. The EHD method can induce a gas-liquid phase separation even in a microliter-sized volume of bubble dispersions, requires no moving parts and offers easy adaptability to electronics. However, it remains unclear the extent to which neutrally buoyant particles subjected to an electric field can mimic the field driven behavior of bubble dispersions in microgravity. The parabolic flight tests are therefore required to provide the ultimate proof-of-concept for the EHD gas-liquid separation in microgravity and elucidate the salient effects of the buoyancy force.','The current level of the EHD technology is TRL 3/4. Parabolic flight tests should provide the ultimate proof-of-concept for the EHD method of the bubble concentration and removal in a microgravity environment. The TRL can be raised to 6/7 and above within 3-4 years after flight tests.','If successful, flight tests should validate the EHD method and provide critical data for the development of EHD devices to control, manipulate, and separate bubbles in a wide range of space technologies.'),(46,'There has been a strong increase of interest in PMC research in recent years as scientists have realized that these clouds are very sensitive indicators for what is going on in the atmosphere at higher altitudes. Due to the extreme cold temperatures and very low density of the mesosphere, small changes in the atmospheric environment can lead to large changes in the properties of these clouds. So by observing these properties and their variability, we can learn a lot about the atmosphere as a whole. But in order to draw solid conclusions about PMCs as indicators for such global processes and trends, we need to obtain a better understanding of the PMCs themselves! How do they form, how do they depend on atmospheric conditions, and how do they interact with their mesospheric environment?\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe objective of this flight experiment is to observe and analyze, for the first time, stabilized imagery obtained through a range of scattering angles in proximity to PMC cloud layers. This experiment is unique in that it can provide very high resolution imagery and tomography data of a PMC layer. We propose to fly an integrated payload consisting of a still-frame camera and a video camera onboard a manned reusable suborbital vehicle from a high-latitude spaceport (e.g. the Kodiak Spaceport in Alaska) at times when Polar Mesospheric Cloud (PMC) activity is observed in late- June of 2013.','There are four components to the proposed observatory: 1) the still frame camera, 2) the HD video camera, 3) the DCS and payload specialist interface, and 4) the space-rated enclosure. The Canon EOS-30D camera is a commercially proven camera that has previously been flown in an unpressurized aircraft to 23,000 feet to study PMCs. The HD video camera is also commercially proven and has been flown to altitudes of 60,000’. Both of these cameras can be currently considered at a TRL of 5. The DCS and the payload specialist interface are heritage of the airborne PMC flight experiment and is considered to be at a TRL of 5. The proposed experiment will raise the TRL of both cameras, DCS, and payload specialist interface to 6 after testing of the integrated package and then to 7 after the successful suborbital flight.','The proposed observatory has applications that are broad in scope. The experiment will provide a better understanding of the small scale dynamics of PMCs due to the greater sensitivity and the proximity of the imagers compared to those on the NASA Small Explorer AIM satellite. As such, it will augment the mission of AIM, extending the science retrieved by the AIM mission. AIM is a $150M spacecraft mission specifically dedicated to the study of PMCs, illustrating the importance that NASA places on the study of these clouds, and the relevance of this experiment. In addition to the study of PMCs, the proposed observatory may be used in a variety of applications, including the imagery of environmental phenomena (e.g. fires, disaster scenes), upper atmospheric imagery (e.g. PMCs and aurora imagery), real-time tactical planning in operational ground campaigns, the acquisition of space weather data, as well as the production of educational outreach products.'),(41,'Important fluid physics mechanisms associated with two-phase systems are flow boiling critical heat flux (CHF) and condensation. Most of the two-phase heat transfer know-how amassed over nearly a century of research comes from experiments that were conducted in Earth’s gravity. This study aims to develop an experimentally validated, mechanistic model for the minimum flow criteria to ensure gravity independent flow boiling critical heat flux (CHF) and condensation. This will require performing extensive parabolic flight experiments in preparation of long-term International Space Station (ISS) experiments. A novel flow boiling and condensation apparatus has been developed jointly by Purdue University and NASA Glenn research Center to perform experimentation to better understand and evaluate the mechanistic models governing such phenomena in terrestrial and reduced gravity.','The technology readiness level of the proposed system is TRL-4. The proposed experiment will utilize a flow boiling system prototype developed previously, along with two new prototype condensation modules. The test results from this proposed work together with the work done at GRC will permit the next level full scale prototype of the system to be designed for evaluation prior to building a mission ready system. Effectively, by testing and determining the viability of the prototype in an applicable environment under reduced gravity, its TRL can be advanced to 5 or better.','Besides NASA, the phenomena at the center of the proposed work (flow boiling and condensation) are of paramount importance to the design of numerous commercial systems and sub-systems. Examples include both fission and fusion nuclear reactors, refrigeration and air conditioning systems, computer electronics, avionics, telecommunication satellites, x-ray medical devices, and metal heat treating.'),(48,'To measure the optical absorption changes along paths through the skin to the brain and back, fNIRS headgear must deliver and collect light at the scalp. Despite the continuing improvement of various research laboratory-based and commercial instrumentation, hardware currently used to couple optical signals to the scalp behind the hairline is bulky, uncomfortable to painful, susceptible to motion artifact and interference from the hair, not expeditiously self-applicable and not readily integrable with existing environments (for example, cockpits and pilot headsets). Reducing such difficulties consistently encountered by those in both industry and academia who uses fNIRS is a design-driven aim. The environment aboard the reduced gravity aircraft provides a platform for testing fNIRS headgear at varying g and vibration levels. The proposed test program will offer an invaluable opportunity to validate the fNIRS headgear in the face of real-world conditions and will allow the design team to address in the future any issues as they work toward flight-like prototypes.','To increase the technology readiness level (TRL) of the fNIRS instrumentation, we propose to test the instrument on a tissue and blood phantom in a realistic flight environment which includes reduced gravity, hyper gravity and at rapidly varying gravity levels. The experiment will utilize a fNIRS prototype developed previously at NASA GRC which has a technology readiness level of TRL-4. Effectively, by testing and determining the viability of the prototype in applicable flight environments under variable gravity and cabin pressure conditions, its TRL can be advanced to 5 or better.','Benefits to NASA are numerous in the disciplines of space exploration and aviation safety. fNIRS could be used to detect cognitive state for pilot or astronaut crew training or to optimize human performance during operations. The success of these efforts to produce “next generation” fNIRS headgear would bring the benefits of the fNIRS technique out of the controlled laboratory and into operational environments, enabling in-task monitoring of crew reaction during safety-critical tasks.'),(38,'SHM technology has already found many applications in ground, naval and aeronautical vehicles. However, application of SHM for spacecraft, despite its obvious future use, has not been thoroughly studied. Difficulty in testing in real space environment is one of impeding obstacles. Until SHM is validated during real missions, limited number of customers would be inclined to integrate this technology into their products. This project is aimed at addressing this difficulty and proposes validation of SHM in a realistic environment. Such a validation implies advancements in understanding of sensor behavior in space environment, influence of space weather, effect re-entry conditions and many other factors.','The hardware tests included in this project are aimed at maturing the SHM technology to the level of practical use in spacecraft. There are several technologies in this project, some at TRL3 and some at TRL4, we hope to reach TRL 5 with the flights.','There are many commercial benefits of the SHM. Components validation, rapid assembly, spacecraft integrity assurance during delivery and launch are among obvious ones. The potential of the SHM technology is enormous and spans from pre-launch diagnostic of space vehicles to in-orbit assessment of structural performance and monitoring of spacecraft disintegration during reentry. It is anticipated that matured SHM technology will improve safety of unmanned and manned spaceflight and could lead to cost reduction in maintenance and operation of spacecrafts. As a part of the “black box” for a space vehicle, SHM data will enable evaluation of structural condition during all stages of the space flight, permit pre- and post-flight diagnosis, facilitate prognosis for future missions and, in a case of a disaster, assist in accident investigation.'),(42,'In 2007 low-gravity regolith-sampling tests were conducted during two flights, each with four sampler head containers for a total of eight test runs. For these first tests, the sampler head rested on the regolith simulants. A second set of regolith sampling tests (two flights, eight test runs) were performed during the FAST flights in 2009. These tests took the next step in demonstration of the sampling technique: movement of the sampler head from above the regolith to contact the regolith simulant, triggering sampling with contact and compression of the telescoping arm. During these tests it was learned that negative g can levitate regolith into the sampler head; the sample head needs to be isolated from the regolith simulant except during the test run while the g-level is low but not negative.','Extensive ground testing and two previous reduced gravity flights have demonstrated the viability of the regolith sampling system. Test series demonstrate sample acquisition in the relevant low-g environment to contribute to achieving TRL-6 prior to the OSIRIS-REx Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in the first quarter of 2013.','Besides OSIRIS-REx, these tests will also benefit any other asteroid or comet nucleus sample acquisition mission in the future by demonstrating the effectiveness of the regolith gas fluidization sampling technique. Future commercial asteroid resource acquisition activities will benefit from the knowledge gained from the demonstration of regolith acquisition and recovery to the spacecraft.'),(37,'In the short term, we have to address the technical challenge of initializing an experiment by first dispersing particulates in a test chamber, then maintaining this dispersion without the material being lost to the chamber walls by adhesion. This is technically non-trivial as we have experienced with particulate dispersions on Space Shuttle (USML-1&2). We have fabricated and tested a mechanically robust vibrational apparatus, the Particle Dispersion System (PDS) that can perform the dual function of initial dispersion and maintenance of particle-free walls. It is a mechanically straightforward system with a 2-axis variable vibrator mechanism mechanically coupled to the walls of a small sealed dispersion chamber. The chamber will be internally illuminated and viewed through a window with a fixed position video recorder.','The payload in its current form and in the form that it will have prior to parabolic flight is consistent with the definition of NASA’s TRL 4, namely, it constitutes a breadboard/brassboard that has been validated in a laboratory setting. Operation of PDS in near zero-g on parabolic flights will advance the system to TRL 5, i.e., it will demonstrate 1) that the proof-of concept functions in a relevant environment and 2) that the observed particle behavior corresponds to that predicted from analysis.','The intended application of the PDS is to conduct studies aboard commercial reusable vehicles that can provide several minutes of zero-gravity.

These stages are packaged into a compact interchangeable cartridge type design to allow for testing individual stages. This modular design also provides the flexibility to add more stages of filters for performance optimization, and to meet design and operational requirements of any NASA mission. Two generations of the system have been built, with private enterprise committing the majority of the effort at no cost to NASA.

Chilldown is the process of introducing the cryogenic liquid into the system, and allowing the hardware to cool down to several hundred degrees Kelvin below the ambient temperature. The chilldown process is anything but routine and requires a well-thought out design to chill down a cryogenic system in a safe and efficient manner. Efficiency of the chilldown process is a significant concern, especially in space, since the cryogenic propellant used to chill down the system is lost and cannot be utilized for propulsion or power generation. We have formed a team with members from academia, NASA Centers and industry to conduct a sRLV flight experiment on cryogenic line chilldown in space microgravity. The main objective is to build an accurate line chilldown database from the experiment under an actual space microgravity condition with a duration long enough to cover the complete chilldown of a fluid transfer line or other hydraulic components.','The technology before the proposed testing is at TRL 4. The system has been tested for short durations first in drop towers (~2s) and then on parabolic flights (~30s), both of which demonstrated the chilldown process in incremental runs. The next step is to test in a long enough duration to accomplish a complete chilldown process in space microgravity or a free fall environment. Testing the chilldown component for a full chilldown using cryogenic propellants in space microgravity will advance the technology to TRL 5, as it will be a component test in a relevant environment.','The microgravity chilldown methodologies and engineering models that will be developed are expected to have direct applications and benefits to both NASA and industry in their research and development on cryogenic storage and transfer systems for future space exploration missions. Transient line chilldown also applies directly to commercial applications involving upper stage engine start after a coast, moving cryogens from a cold vessel to a warm vessel, and other operations that involve the transport of cryogens in space. It has applications to propellant storage and transfer including propellant depots, long duration missions that include propellant transfer in the concept of operations, and missions that have long dormant periods between cryogenic engine starts.'),(9,'One of the greatest challenges in developing a good simulation platform is accurately simulating the dynamic response of a free-floating object. The data collected during the proposed flight will help better characterize the current models used in the facility. Current ground simulations of on- orbit autonomous robotic capture do not adequately model the small-scale 3D contact dynamics between a robot and a satellite. ','The data collected during the campaign will mature autonomous capture algorithms as well as help quantify a ground-based dynamics simulation platform. Prior to the flight opportunity, the autonomous capture technology will be at a TRL-4. Testing the autonomous capture in a relevant environment (i.e., near-zero gravity) will raise the TRL to 5 after the flight. The flight will also advance the TRL of the ground-based contact dynamics simulation platform by providing some “truth” data to the behavior of a free-floating object being touched by a robotic manipulator.','The proposed technology has relevance to many NASA Centers and is applicable to a wide range of critical missions. The autonomous capture technology can be applied to any Center working on capturing non-cooperative targets in space for servicing or debris removal. It can also be applied to sample return work. The contact dynamics simulation platform is applicable to any Center involved with the work above (servicing, debris removal, sample return, etc.) as well as proximity operations around asteroids.

Several publication have discussed the use of this ground to ionosphere potential as a tracer of global change, and several researchers have investigated how changing electric fields influence cloud formation. Yet routine and consistent observations are lacking, therefore, an eventual goal is to use the proposed sensor suite to ultimately measure the electric field outside of the spacecraft to study global change effects on the global electric circuit and long term variability in the lower thermosphere/ionosphere.','By utilizing existing (and COTS) electric field mill and magnetometer sensors, we significantly reduce risk associated with this experiment. Once the two sensors are integrated, we will conduct laboratory tests at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory to optimize the sensor suite for suborbital spaceflight conditions. However, the TRL will still be limited. Therefore, the upcoming suborbital reusable launch vehicle test flights provide a excellent opportunity to operationally test this sensor suite under actual launch conditions. The successful completion of this proposed sensor suite should lay the ground work for achieving a TRL 9 if not actually achieving that level.','This project intends to construct and deploy an instrument suite that provides for a wide range of applications for multiple customers. Initially, accurate measurements of the electromagnetic fields around the suborbital reusable launch vehicles are essential for successful operation of many of the types of scientific payloads anticipated to utilize such vehicles.

Additionally, the overall capability of the sRLV to support future test demonstrations with representative lunar or planetary trajectories will be matured to TRL 9.','Precision landing AGNC is applicable to future NASA landing missions to the Moon or planets, to future proposed precursor landing missions, commercial landing missions and potential Near-Earth Object missions. Previous efforts on each of these missions have identified the benefits of precision landing and hazard avoidance capability, but have all avoided implementation due to risk. E.g., every incarnation of human landing has identified the desire to land in more hazardous terrain, under less-desirable lighting constraints, requiring precision landing and hazard avoidance, but no program has baselined the capability within its concepts of operations. The extended capability of the sRLV to incorporate the Precision Landing AGNC would enable a broader range of flight opportunities and provides confidence that closed-loop flight demonstrations can be performed safely benefiting future OCT Flight Opportunities payloads.'),(17,'The IsoTherm concept was inspired by the circulatory system of biological organisms, which is highly efficient and provides multiple functions within one system, including thermal regulation, oxygen flow, and constituents for self-healing. By adapting this multi-functional architecture to the structural panels of a satellite bus, impressive performance improvements may be realized. While several studies have been conducted showing that electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps can operate effectively in two-phase applications, all were conducted in 1g environments. It is well known that the behavior of two-phase flows is quite different in microgravity, and this will affect the performance of the EHD pump. A thorough characterization of IsoTherm is necessary for optimization of the current system and to design future generations of two-phase multifunctional structures.','The anticipated outcome of the experiment is a better understanding of how microgravity will affect the performance of IsoTherm. This includes the effects on the power required for an EHD pump to deliver a desired flow rate and pressure head, the change in heat transfer coefficient between the IsoTherm channels and an electronic component that needs to be cooled, the maximum heat flux IsoTherm is capable of dissipating, and the power required to operate IsoTherm as a function of applied heat load. This understanding will help advance IsoTherm to TRL 6.','IsoTherm is an adaptable, cross-cutting technology that can be applied to all high-power spacecraft, cutting weight and increasing power capabilities for nearly all future missions.'),(22,'We intend to demonstrate an instrument suite consisting of modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) instruments. This suite combines the previous experiment (electric field mill and magnetometer sensors) with a dual frequency GPS receiver and IMU for observing the environment (with observations and models) inside and in the vicinity of suborbital reusable launch vehicles. The initial objective of this experiment is to characterize the electromagnetic field and inertial environment inside the spacecraft to provide insight and allow for mitigation of possible negative impacts of these conditions on instrumentation as well as payload experiments.','This experiment benefits from using COTS instrumentation so that the basic instruments have already been designed, developed and produced and prior to testing, our proposed instrument package will at least be at a TRL level of 5. After assembling the instrument suite, we will begin testing at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to verify operational capability in the launch and suborbital environments with necessary modifications applied as necessary. After testing, the instrument suite is expected to be at TRL 7. This will lead into the 30-40 km altitude test flight experiment addressed in this experiment on a suborbital reusable launch vehicle. This flight demonstration should raise our instrument package to at least a TRL 8 level and ensure it is ready for operation on the subsequently regularly scheduled flights at higher altitudes.','This instrument suite provides for a wide range of applications for multiple customers. Initially, accurate measurements of the inertial environment and electromagnetic fields around the suborbital reusable launch vehicles are essential for successful operation of many of the types of scientific payloads anticipated to utilize such vehicles. Such information is required to accurately interpret instrument and/or experimental data. Additionally, the operators of these vehicles also require such information for effective operation in order to avoid unintended impacts to vehicle electronics.'),(23,'With changes in altitude, one observes variations in the selective absorption of celestial radiation as a function of wavelength. As an example, at near-infrared wavelengths, the background limit of ground-based and stratospheric observations is caused by airglow in the Earth\'s mesosphere. With an ambient telescope temperature of 240 K, the background limit for observations at wavelengths of < 3 microns is limited by OH airglow. The altitude of Earth\'s OH layer as determined by satellite observations is at altitudes of less than 295,000 feet (90 km). Whereas UAVs, like the Global Hawk, are limited to altitude of < 60,000 feet (18.3 km), and balloons are limited to altitude of < 110,000 feet (33.5 km), next generation suborbital vehicles are intended to reach altitude of 300,000 feet (> 90 km) and are expected to get above this ever present source of near-infrared emission. It is therefore relevant to consider the development of a compact low cost spectrometer to measure the OH background as a function of altitude between 100,000 and 300,000 feet. Aside from background measurements, a suitable instrument could also measure the selective absorption attributed to CH4 and CO2.','Although existing suborbital vehicles identified in the current Flight Opportunities Program are limited to altitudes of < 100,000 feet (< 30 km), it is essential that we gain the initial flight experience with a low cost commercial spectrometer to evaluate the challenges of observations with vertical take-off and landing vehicles. This proposal will serve as the technology demonstration of the overall concept and the ability to work with the vehicle provider for integration, test, and pointed operations prior to a follow-up proposal for a suborbital science program.','For the observations considered, this is of benefit to the planetary and solar system science community. Having demonstrated the actual near-infrared background within the mesosphere, it may be possible to consider the development of an observational system suitable for studies of solar system objects within the sun avoidance angle of existing and future space-based observatories.'),(24,'Low-gravity testing of the RFMG will enable us to address two of the TRL-6 milestones, namely 1) Complete short duration cryogenic flight experiment(s) to obtain data to mature models of critical fluid/thermal physics, and 2) Demonstrate microgravity venting, liquid acquisition, and quantity gauging of LO2 and LH2.','Upon successful completion of these tests, core elements of the RFMG will advance to TRL-7 since they will have been tested in an actual flight environment (the electronics will still be at the TRL-5, 6 level). At that stage, the technology will be relatively low-risk for implementing on a space-based payload or vehicle.','Two commercial aerospace companies, Boeing and United Launch Alliance (ULA), are interested in the RFMG technology. NASA and Boeing have established a Space Act Agreement so that Boeing could evaluate the RFMG in a large scale cryogenic test demonstration. In addition, we are collaborating with ULA to define possible flight testing of the RFMG on a cryogenic testbed experiment. Other commercial niche applications of the RFMG may include gauging sRLV tanks, gauging of liquid hydrogen storage tanks, and high-performance aircraft and race car tanks where fuel sloshing might affect accurate gauging.'),(28,'The proposed assessment of device functionality as well as identification of problem areas will ultimately guide efforts for modification and improvement so that these highly capable medical tools can be used effective for physiologic data acquisition for commercial spaceflight participants and researchers during parabolic flight, future commercial space platforms, and other areas that require continuous measurements of health and performance.','The Vital Space system is currently at a technology readiness level of 4 (TRL 4). The proposed zero-G flights are to migrate the Vital Space technology to TRL 5 & 6 where components, sub-systems, and systems are demonstrated as operational in the micro-gravity environment.','We feel that a physiologic monitoring system in the form of the Vital Space System could provide substantial value to both the growing commercial human spaceflight sector as well as becoming a useful tool to fulfill NASA goals as outlined on the technology roadmap for human spaceflight. Furthermore, we foresee that the lessons learned from physiologic monitoring using the Vital Space System could provide clinical benefit by helping to preventing adverse health outcomes and reduce health care utilization by employing predictive analytics algorithms and providing a model for wireless medical data capture and analysis in the rapidly growing field of wireless medical devices.'),(29,'We propose a series of low-energy impact experiments to be carried out in reduced-gravity (lunar and free-fall) on parabolic airplane flights. The experiment is a modified version of the Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment (PRIME) that was flown previously on parabolic airplane flights. Modifications to the experiment enable higher quality video data as well as free-float of the experiment to obtain lower residual accelerations and better simulate the space environment of a small asteroid.','Experiments dealing with dust in space environments are likely to be performed on the International Space Station. From a pure technology development standpoint, the proposed test will advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of components of science experiments to be proposed for use on the ISS. The technology described in this document has been extensively tested in a laboratory setting and is ready for analysis in a reduced-gravity environment. The current TRL of PRIME is 6. PRIME’s operational capabilities have previously been demonstrated in the relevant environment of simulated zero-gravity. Through this flight opportunity, the experiment and all of its components can mature to a TRL of 8.','The results of this technology test will lead to advances in our understanding of the phenomena of dust dynamics near the surfaces of asteroids and moons with low surface gravity. These objects are the targets of planned NASA missions, including OSIRIS-Rex and potential future human exploration missions.'),(30,'The risk of visual impairment and elevated intracranial pressure is currently the #1 risk for NASA\'s Space Life Sciences Directorate and the #3 risk for the ISS Program. Due to the invasive nature of current intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement techniques, there is very little data regarding crewmember ICP values post-flight, and no preflight or inflight data are feasible. ICP changes during and post-flight will be needed in order to understand the mechanisms leading to the problem, develop countermeasures, and provide appropriate treatment for crewmembers. This research proposes to directly validate and refine non-invasive ICP methodology for inflight monitoring of ICP; these same methods can easily be applied to pre- and post-flight data collection efforts.','The successful completion of the proposed activities would select, validate, and refine a method (or potentially a combination of methods) for monitoring ICP and intra-ocular pressure (IOP) of crewmembers in flight. Barring major technical issues that prohibit operation in a microgravity environment, the deliverable would be a technology solution investigated at TRL4-5 and delivered at high TRL (6), complete with training materials and methods for inexperienced operators. This solution could then quickly enter either operational or payload development for testing inflight.','The research will allow us to provide recommendations to NASA regarding the flight readiness of the candidate technologies, modifications, and education required for transition to the ISS. An accurate and easy-to-use non-invasive ICP measurement technology would also have broad terrestrial applicability ranging from the military, remote trauma medicine, emergency rooms, and outpatient monitoring of patients with known or suspected ICP elevation.'),(31,'For over 40 years it has been known that when the skeleton is unloaded, either by microgravity or continuous bed rest, a series of cascading events occur that result in loss of bone mineral density. This loss of bone and muscle strength may have serious consequences during and after long-duration space flight missions. The potential osteoprotective effect of partial gravity environments on bone is unknown and it is important to better understand the extent of bone loss and develop mitigation strategies. This project offers a non-invasive, predictive approach to the monitoring and maintenance of bone health during space missions which is an alternative to imaging or the collection and analysis of biomarkers that result from bone breakdown.','The system is currently at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5. The system components are well integrated and the technology has been thoroughly tested in a simulated environment using the Enhanced Zero-gravity Locomotion Simulator at NASA Glenn Research Center. The hardware has also been worn for a brief period by a single test subject on a previous parabolic flight. Testing during parabolic flight will move the TRL forward to 7 allowing demonstration in an operational environment.','This research may result in the formulation of potential exercise regimens to counter the effects of space flight on bone density and muscle atrophy. Accurate and detailed ambulatory activity monitoring with the added benefit of software predicting bone health is also a tool that would be highly sought after by athletic trainers, the aging population, osteoporotic patients, and elderly care personnel. This project has the potential to produce a NASA spinoff that would benefit the above-mentioned populations through personal bone health monitoring systems.'),(34,'Draper will use the Stereo Testbed with Inertial Navigation and GPS Receiver Attached to You (STINGRAY). The Guidance Embedded Navigator Integration Environment (GENIE) currently being adapted by Draper to perform closed-loop Autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (AGNC) with a Flight Opportunities sRLV provider will be leveraged to interface with STINGRAY. STINGRAY will be adapted to integrate its vision navigation data as an open loop navigation source into the GENIE navigation system. In addition to maturing the vision navigation technology, Draper proposes to fly planetary trajectories using GENIE to control the sRLV and address relevant environments for demonstrating vision navigation, pioneering the capabilities of the Flight Opportunities vehicles to safely demonstrate planetary flight profiles.','Draper continues to make progress maturing the technology and anticipates achieving TRL-5 prior to start of the proposed flight test campaigns. Through this Flight Opportunities technology demonstration STINGRAY will achieve TRL-6. The flight demonstration will leverage the GENIE AGNC system which is TRL-5 today and anticipated to be TRL-6 in the near future through a current Flight Opportunities technology demonstration.','The flight demonstrations will reduce risks for future NASA missions by demonstrating an integrated vision state determination through a range of planetary trajectory flight demonstrations. In addition to planetary landing navigation and hazard avoidance applications, an integrated vision navigation system has broad reaching NASA, commercial, and DoD application. For example, a system like STINGRAY could be used to support other space applications such as autonomous rendezvous and docking of spacecraft as well as proximity operations with non cooperative spacecraft. Vision based navigation systems are also applicable to applications such as autonomous helicopters vehicles, precision airdrop, subsea navigation and other land based vehicles where vision based navigation, targeting, and hazard avoidance are of benefit. Vision navigation for small sized air vehicles for indoor application where GPS is unavailable would also be useful. Other DoD applications include advanced soldier navigation and targeting for small unmanned aerial systems.'),(36,'The presence of dust on the surfaces of solar system bodies raises several technical issues related to unmanned and manned exploration of the solar system. Fine grains may damage optical instruments, coat solar panels, or jam moving parts on spacecraft. Particles that enter astronaut habitats can pose a further health hazard through inhalation or contamination of seals or other equipment. A broad set of experimental data in the reduced-gravity regime in which these collisions occur is necessary to interpret the existing and ever-growing volume of data on dust in planetary systems.','Experiments dealing with dust in space environments are likely to be performed on the International Space Station. From a pure technology development standpoint, the proposed test will advance the TRL of components of science experiments to be proposed for use on the ISS. The technology described in this document has been extensively tested in a laboratory setting and is ready for analysis in a reduced-gravity environment. The current Test Readiness Level (TRL) of COLLIDE-3 is 6 (with some components at TRL 7). The operational capabilities of some of the internal components of COLLIDE-3 have previously been demonstrated in the operational environment of space. Through this flight opportunity, the experiment and all of its components can mature to a TRL of 8.','The results of this technology test will lead to advances in our understanding of the phenomena of dust dynamics near the surfaces of asteroids and moons with low surface gravity. These objects are the targets of planned NASA missions, including OSIRIS-Rex and potential future manned and unmanned exploration missions. It is critical for the development of experiments, hardware, and procedures to understand the behavior of regolith in response to disturbances produced in normal exploration activities. '),(39,'Under microgravity conditions, measurements of liquid/fuel contents in a tank becomes problematic because the liquid in the tank is always unsettled, sloshing, not wall bounded, and flowing. The measurement is further complicated because it is highly desired to have the measurement capability that would result in an accuracy in the range 1-5%. Several promising techniques are currently under development including the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) method and the optical mass gauge (OMG), which senses the fluid quantity by measuring absorption of light in a tank. A third option is the Radio Frequency (RF) mass gauge that emits a radio frequency signal and measures the electromagnetic resonances of the tank to infer the quantity of propellant. Also, the methods based on the acoustic principle using Helmholtz resonator are also being proposed to measure fuel mass under zero gravity. The proposed ECVT technology here is unique because it images (3-dimensional) dielectric profile of the medium inside a tank through measurements of mutual capacitances between capacitive electrodes embedded in the inner surface of a storage tank.','The technology readiness level of the ECVT fuel mass gauging is at TRL-4. By flying the ECVT imaging system on the zero-G aircraft, it will be possible to validate its performance under a real zero-G condition. Maturing the ECVT technology through zero-G flight opportunities will be an important step in extending its applications to monitor the flow of fluid and gaseous fuel through pipes, buffer tanks and other components used in a propulsion system.','Development and successful validation of the ECVT imaging system will enable NASA engineers to study the fluid sloshing and other important science phenomenon (such as science of combustion) under zero gravity space environments.'),(40,'This project is for a study of the microgravity effects on nanoscale mixing of a diffusion limited process using electrochemical electrodes. In previous research by Micro-G CANM 1, the electrochemical oxidation of ammonia in microgravity conditions was utilized as the means to characterize a variety of nanomaterials according to their catalytic activity. The results of these parabolic aircraft experiments led to the measurement of a 20-65% decrease in the catalytic current under microgravity. This reduction in catalytic current is hypothesized to occur due to the lack of buoyancy driven mixing at the solution-electrode interface. It is believed that this effect is influenced by the pore size and structure of the material. This lack of buoyancy driven mixing at the solution-electrode interface may be addressed by inducing hydrodynamic turbulent mixing and by the reengineering of the electrode geometry and pore structure. The objective of this project is to test these mitigation approaches and develop a better understanding of this phenomenon.','The proposed research meets the requirements for the classification of a TRL 5 (Component and or breadboard validation in a relevant environment).','This project is critical to the development of the FOST and failure to complete this work will result in a failure to meet key NGLS milestones. The design of the electrodes in the EAR is critical to the correct sizing of the EAR and thus the FOST system. '),(44,'The objectives of the experiment are to study how the reduced gravity conditions influence the formation of the micro-structures in the sintering process of powder materials, and to demonstrate that materials obtained through this process have better characteristics of strength and uniformity as compared to ground-based processes. This is a big advantage for applications to space exploration (construction of moon bases using lunar soil powder), and to the production of shaped materials for industry (alloys, filters, bearings or special objects)','The experiment hardware has been assessed at TRL-6. The furnace can be considered as a high fidelity prototype of the one intended for materials processing in space. Results from the parabolic flights may advance the maturity of the technology to the following levels, involving the construction of a fully automated machine capable of extracting and processing the lunar soil, in order to produce locally the materials to be used by human settlements on the Moon. \r\n','The innovative process carried out by the experiment will demonstrate the composite powders\' sintering under reduced gravity and in vacuum conditions, which can allow the possibility of obtaining high quality materials for ISFR (In Situ Fabrication and Repair) and ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilization) for applications in reduced gravity environment, such as the Moon and Mars surfaces. NASA and other International Space Agencies as well as private commercial organizations and companies can benefit from this research for the design and construction of material processing equipment associated with their Moon and other celestial bodies Exploration Programs.'),(45,'The low gravity flight opportunity will provide quantitative data in terms of pressure and temperature that will characterize the difference in performance from normal gravity and low gravity. Analytical models, correlated with the low gravity flight results, can then be used to design the HMC space flight hardware. Basic knowledge gained from this flight can also be used to develop other types of evaporation-based hardware, such as Brine-dewatering and Laundry Systems.','The proposed payload will be at TRL 4 prior to the flight opportunity. After the low gravity flight testing, the TRL for the HMC will be partially at TRL 5, since this is only one component of a the HMC. This will be the first-ever testing of this process in low gravity, so this flight will result in a major leap in TRL for this technology. ','The specific benefit of the proposed activity to a NASA mission, program, or project is the ability to design and develop a critical piece of hardware for life support and exploration of our solar system, the Heat Melt Compactor. The data will allow sizing of heaters and operational scenarios (how long will it take to dry the trash). This hardware is planned on all future Exploration missions and useful for ISS as well.'),(47,'BUSAT\'s modular design is based on a standard 10 cm cube that is capable of functioning as an independent orbiting radio transponder and scientific satellite in the 3U CubeSat format, but can also scale up to a 27U nanosatellite configuration. The cubes are fixed within a modular exoskeleton that supports solar panels and communication antennas. Because of the common universal interfaces between cubes, any cube can be relocated and re-oriented within the satellite to suit mission requirements, such as the need for apertures or instrument pointing. Rather than create unique power and communication systems for each payload or mission, BUSAT sets a common physical layer, software and mechanical protocol design and is assembled in less than two hours (instrument delivery to test and integration phases). The mechanical solar panel and antenna deployment assemblies are also completely modular, allowing maximum flexibility in mounting orientation and location.\r\n<br><BR>\r\nUtilizing the Triangular Advanced Solar Cells (\"TASC Cells\") available from Spectrolab Photovoltaic Products, nine of the 10 cm x 10 cm scalable antenna panels are mounted to a 30 cm x 30 cm aluminum substructure and constrained during launch by a TINI Aerospace Frangibolt™.  BUSAT’s antenna arrays also built in a 1U configuration.  Based on the concept of a tape measure, the flat spring-material flexible antenna system is capable of deploying to the correct orientation from multiple contained configurations. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe solar panel deployment system makes use of a non-pyrotechnic, fracturing bolt device which allows for spring hinges to swing the panels into an open position. As the panels open, antenna boxes positioned underneath them will extend spring-loaded, flexible antenna coils into predetermined orientations and will fix them in this orientation for the duration of the space mission. Due to the nature of these stored energy devices it is highly desirable to analyze their responsiveness in the closest approximation possible to actual condition. With several components moving simultaneously, it is important to establish that the antenna extension does not interfere with solar panel deployment while both devices are in the process of locking in place. Multiple parabolic flights are desired in order to obtain results with different hardware configurations and orientations. These tests are intended to establish the most reliable deployment strategy which will allow for the highest possibility of success in space-ready versions of these two components.','The BUSAT mechanical deployment subsystem is currently at TRL 5-6. Due to the successful repeated deployments in the microgravity environment, the solar panel deployment mechanism (kinematic mounting structure, TINI Frangibolt™ mounting assembly, custom hinges) have progressed to TRL 6.  The antenna assembly progressed to TRL 5, and lessons learned during the microgravity flight campaign are feeding back to a modified design.','The result of the BUSAT program will be an integrated satellite bus that utilizes reliable, low cost, highly adaptive, standardized components. The direct results of this test plan will create the blueprints for an “off the shelf” communications and solar panel deployment mechanism that can be integrated into nearly any cube-sat sized satellite project. CubeSats missions are currently in all stages of development throughout the defense, civilian and university space research communities. Trade studies are currently underway to identify future customers in each of these communities, and seek to identify mission developers interested in minimizing the cost of development and launch.'),(50,'The main challenge to achieving diffraction-limited performance from a balloon is motion compensation. This is a two-part problem requiring both a pointing error signal and a pointing correction system. Our first flight addresses the problem of the pointing error: we will fly a modified version of the ST5000 daytime star tracker with 0.1 arc second pointing resolution that we successfully flew on a NSC balloon in May 2011. The star tracker will have new optics and a larger format detector to reduce background and provide higher spatial resolution. The second flight will demonstrate a 10-inch telescope with an orthogonal transfer CCD (OTCCD) array as an integrated tip-tilt correction device. They represent a simple, robust image compensation system with no moving parts.','Our first flight payload, the daytime star tracker, will be at TRL 4 by April 2012. After flight it will achieve TRL 9 (Actual system flight proven). Our second payload, a small telescope with an OTCCD camera, will be constructed under a Southwest Research Institute Internal Research program and will be completed by September 2011. After thermal-vac testing, the OTCCD camera will have a TRL 6 rating (demonstration in a relevant environment). After flight it will also have achieved TRL 9 (Actual system flight proven).','Combined with the means to point at the 0.1\" level in day or night and the means to perform image stabilization at the 0.05\" level, a robust, no-moving-parts camera will enable balloon-borne telescopes to compete with HST, but at a vastly lower cost.'),(51,'Our Stanford team has developed a non-invasive hemodynamic monitor based on the measurement of the ballistocardiogram (reaction force due to blood flow) using a weighing scale. This system has been thoroughly tested in multiple clinical trials, and has shown to be effective in monitoring changes in cardiac output, contractility and other cardiovascular parameters. Compared to other BCG monitors based on the recording of the free-floating body acceleration, this system has the advantage to allow recording both on the ground and in microgravity. This way, data measured in weightless environments can be interpreted in light of the large body of data that has been gathered on the ground, significantly facilitating the validation of the method. Moreover, this platform also enables the comparison of free-floating acceleration BCG to scale-based BCG, therefore providing a means to compare current studies of free-floating acceleration BCG (such as ESA-sponsored B3D program) with ground-based studies – something currently not possible. We aim to further the development of this technology and demonstrate its usefulness in microgravity in a series of parabolic flights.','From a TRL of 4, we expect to bring the system to a TRL of 6 following this campaign. In addition, the joint measurement of the free-floating acceleration BCG will provide key data towards the cross-validation of these two complementary modes of measurements, therefore advancing the wider community.','The adaptations required for micro-gravity use will benefit commercial embodiment of this system, for instance through the validation of noise-cancellation algorithms. The weighing-scale BCG platform has many commercial applications related to non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring, both in hospital and home monitoring. Our BCG scale system has already been used at Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Hospital, and in a private cardiology clinic (Cardiovascular Medicine and Cardiac Arrhythmias, now Silicon Valley Cardiology).'),(52,'We propose an experimental program that tests the collection of asteroid regolith by subjecting the experiment to microgravity conditions which will closely simulate the environmental conditions on the surface of an asteroid. Asteroid 1999 RQ36 that will be explored by OSIRIS-Rex beginning in 2019 has a mass ~ 10-12 times less than the Moon. Particular interest at near-zero gravity will be emphasized in order to determine the effects of very low gravity on regolith collection and contact with instrumentation.','The reduced-gravity regolith collection experiments will advance the TRL of experiment hardware for future scientific experiments on asteroids.

All presently conceivable FOP sRLV scientific experiments will require knowledge of the actual flight environment as a function of time during the flight.  The compact 2.2 kg package comprised of commercially available instruments is designed to measure and record stand-alone shock, vibration, temperature, pressure and relative humidity measurement. The SFEM can record data for up to 4 hours. The SFEM’s mechanical interface is robust, yet simple and requires no modification to any vehicle. Additionally, the SFEM is completely autonomous and does not require any comm or power interface with launch vehicles. The information gathered on early FOP sRLV flights to characterize the payload environment will help to guide payload builds and determine the microgravity quality for future investigators.'),(3,'The need and demand for long term space missions, such as missions to Near Earth Object’s (NEO’s) and interplanetary missions, is growing rapidly. To satisfy this demand, on-orbit propellant storage and transfer technologies are being developed. The ability to re-fuel a space system, once on-orbit, will provide a means of success for these types of space missions without the need for continual development and advancement of heavy lift vehicles. Additionally, the adaptation of existing technology will allow on-orbit refueling of spacecraft to become a near term reality, cutting the need for advanced heavy launch vehicle development as well as the corresponding cost, time, and manpower.'),(4,'Made in Space, Inc. will fly 3D printers on parabolic and sub-orbital research flights to further develop the application of 3D printing technology to micro- and zero-gravity environments. The 3D printing method used on these flights will be Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a technique that has already undergone limited testing in microgravity conditions, in which a feedstock is melted and extruded in a predefined pattern. These test flights and subsequent evaluation of the constructed materials will enhance the TRL level of in-situ space manufacturing via 3D printing techniques. '),(5,'The use of two-phase thermal systems on spacecraft has been greatly hampered by the inability to predict with sufficient confidence their performance at various gravity levels (Earth, Mars, and lunar gravity and low-g). The performance prediction of two-phase systems under these conditions requires a sufficient heat transfer database and reliable models, both of which are not currently available. Although some research in low-gravity adiabatic flows has been performed, very little heat transfer data relevant to advanced space heat exchangers is available and the mechanisms by which heat is removed from the surfaces under varying gravity environments are still unclear. A better understanding of flow boiling and critical heat flux (CHF) in these environments is highly desired for the design of future heat removal equipment in extraterrestrial applications.'),(6,'Pool boiling is a highly effective mode of heat transfer allowing high heat flux levels driven by relatively small temperature differences between the heated wall and the liquid. In spite of its efficiency, cooling based on liquid-vapor phase change processes has not yet found wide application in aerospace engineering due to specific process uncertainties and related reliability problems associated with the low gravity environment. Even less is known about the impact of electric fields on heat transfer in boiling in microgravity and their potential for heat transfer enhancement under such conditions. The primary objective of the experiment is to determine the effect of electric fields on pool boiling in low-g.'),(7,'Propellant quantity gauging is a critical function for space vehicles, yet the only way to gauge the amount of propellants in a low-gravity environment is to “settle” the liquid in the tanks by accelerating the vehicle and measuring the liquid level. Although this settled-gauging technique works well in many instances, e.g. during launch or main engine burns, it has drawbacks and penalties. At a low settling thrust the liquid slosh times are long, leading to inaccurate level sensor data. The penalty for this propellant gauging inaccuracy is additional propellant load, to cover the uncertainty margin. Without a settling thrust, the propellant quantity is even more uncertain. These difficulties could be overcome with a low-gravity propellant gauging technology, such as the Radio Frequency Mass Gauge (RFMG). The RFMG is a technology being developed at NASA to gauge cryogenic propellants in low-gravity, or under low settling thrust conditions where sloshing is also an issue. The technique has been proven to work very well in ground tests using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, but lacks substantial low-g testing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Bibliography</b><br>\r\nG. A.

A series of tests run in 2008 showed that the ADA beta prototype configuration was capable of extinguishing 90% of test fires with less than one pound of fine water mist. In 2009, ADA designed, fabricated and delivered to Jacobs Technology an advanced prototype that incorporated multiple features deemed essential to operation in manned spacecraft. Continued development of a prototype portable FWM extinguisher via an ADA Phase II SBIR project offers NASA the opportunity to substantially advance this technology toward implementation on the next generation of manned spacecraft in a very efficient use of resources.'),(11,'The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR®) VF-200 is scheduled to fly onboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2014. The VF-200 is a high-power, 200 kW, plasma rocket prototype that will be used to demonstrate and validate key VASIMR® technologies and related plasma exhaust plume physics in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), enabling a possible paradigm shift in high power electric propulsion for manned and unmanned spacecraft. The baseline VF-200 design includes a set of High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnet assemblies that are conduction-cooled by cryocoolers. These flights will allow for characterization of the cryocoolers’ natural vibrational modes in varying levels of gravity, from 1g in our lab to Lunar 0.16g, to Martian 0.38g, and to near 0g during parabolic flights.'),(14,'Fission power provides game-changing solutions for powering advanced NASA missions. Radiators are needed to reject waste heat from Fission Power Systems (FPS). Titanium – water heat pipes are being considered for use in the radiators of a fission power system option for lunar exploration. Embedded in the radiators and deployed on the surface, heat pipes would be oriented vertically and would operate as thermosyphons, a subset of heat pipes that have no wick in their condenser. Their design is determined in part by the flooding limit which is attributed to the interfacial shear force at the boundary between liquid and vapor, and occurs when concurrent vapor flow is so severe that liquid flow is prevented. Flooding is determined by the thickness of the fluid film on the walls and the interaction of fluid flow with concurrent vapor counter flow, both inversely proportional to gravity. The planned test objective of this project is to validate the gravity-dependent flooding limit model for thermosyphons.'),(25,'Exposure to novel gravitational environments elicits alterations in sensorimotor responses, such as changes in coordinated head-and-eye movements and variations in spatial perception and memory. Functional consequences include an impaired ability to read, disorientation, dizziness, postural and locomotor disturbances, and motion sickness. Thus, it would be advantageous to design a technology that can quickly and effectively assess sensorimotor function. This study consists of an engineering evaluation in parabolic flight of two novel technologies, one that quantifies vestibulo-ocular function without eye movement recording, and another that estimates an individual’s ability to accurately perceive and report his or her orientation in space. Both technologies incorporate the same portable device that requires little computational power and is simple to use.'),(26,'There is currently no medical thoracic drainage system and suction capability that can function with a thoracic chest tube drainage system in the space operational environment. Terrestrial models of thoracic chest drainage systems are based upon a gravity dependant fluid system that requires an upright position for the device. This project seeks to flight test a modification to an existing medical chest drainage system and demonstrate the functionality in a microgravity environment. This is to show proof of concept. The modification uses a novel combination of devices that are FDA approved for human use. It is hoped that by demonstrating a novel combination that is effective in microgravity the enhanced capabilities of this suction device could be utilized in additional terrestrial applications such as medical transport and battlefield medicine.'),(27,'The objective of this project is to develop, test, and verify the functionality of a fully automated cell culture apparatus that will allow for the growth of three-dimensional (3-D) cultures in microgravity. The development of a fully automated 3-D cell culture apparatus for microgravity is important because these 3-D cell cultures can be used to accurately model fully differentiated normal human tissue for the study of the effects of radiation and other non-radiation space environment stressors on multiple biological processes. Additionally, the 3-D organotypic cultures can provide a realistic model for the evaluation of countermeasures such as drug delivery. The long-term objective of this work is to develop an automated cell culture apparatus that can be used to efficiently study the growth of 3-D cell cultures aboard the International Space Station.'),(20,'NASA, the United States Air Force, other government agencies, and commercial and academic groups continue to develop two-phase systems for space applications in numerous areas. For example, JSC specifically is avidly interested in two-phase systems for active thermal control and life support. Other areas of potential for these systems include in-situ resource utilization designs for planetary missions, spacecraft using nuclear-based power generation, propellant transfer, and commercial space processing. The primary objective of MFEST is to conduct a pathfinder, suborbital flight experiment that focuses on two-phase fluid flow and separator operations through a representative launch, suborbital, and entry profile.'),(32,'The UAHuntsville CubeSat is a student satellite development project to design, build, test, and operate an orbital picosatellite. The program has a primary focus of designing a 1U CubeSat system that accomplishes three primary technology demonstrations: (1) passive nadir axis stabilization for picosatellite attitude control, (2) improved communications for a stabilized 1U satellite system, and (3) deployable solar panels for increased solar power collection on a picosatellite system. The opportunity to perform microgravity deployment tests on a parabolic aircraft will increase the technology readiness level of the CubeSat deployment mechanisms to level 6 and will improve the understanding of how the deployable systems react in the unconstrained microgravity environment. This will allow mechanical functioning of the hardware and verification of the attitude stabilization modeling.'),(33,'To support the periodic launch of reusable launch vehicles, some sanitization of the airspace must occur to ensure that the area around the launch and landing sites are clear of air traffic. One of the major concerns is the uncertainty of the vehicle’s descent path, especially while flying under parachute. This project aims to evaluate a prototype UAT-based (Universal Access Transceiver) ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) transponder developed to support commercial space transportation. A UAT-based ADS-B receiver will provide the same capabilities that an ADS-B receiver provides for manned space flight. It broadcasts to ground-based and airborne receivers the current altitude and position of the vehicle once per second. It is anticipated that the developed prototype will become a standard payload on any flight of reusable launch vehicles once it has been proven robust and reliable.'),(12,'The specific objective of this experiment is to take fluorescent imaging instrumentation developed for our shuttle and ISS experiments and calibrate the hardware and data collection capabilities to timeframes optimal for parabolic flight and suborbital applications. We will build on extensive insights gained from spaceflight and ISS deployments of similar technologies, along with PI experience on previous parabolic flight campaigns, to address future science and technology deployments in parabolic and suborbital campaigns. This technology has longer term development potential for small satellite and planetary lander applications as well, and speaks directly to aspects of the Nanotechnology Road Map (Technology Area 10), particularly the development of sensitive, next-generation imagers that can collect data telemetrically, and in real time.'),(13,'The MEMS (Micro‐Electro-Mechanical Systems) Radiation project is developing a miniaturized microfluidic (lab‐on-a‐chip) device that is designed to monitor DNA damage, in real‐time, resulting from radiation exposure in space. The instrument under development will (a) use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA, (b) thermally image the micro‐device to monitor thermal gradients for proper thermal exposure, and (c) use fluorescent imaging to monitor radiation‐induced changes in DNA composition. The ultimate goal is to help understand the details of radiation exposure in space and potentially serve as a radiation rapid warning device for astronauts.'),(21,'The management of multiphase flows is a key element in many space systems, from fuel tanks to Environmental Control & Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Recent theoretical and experimental works have shown that vibrations play a fundamental role in the behaviour of these flows in microgravity. A system generating the required vibrations for each application can be an efficient technology to manage multiphase flows in space. In this experiment we present a payload for the generation of controlled harmonic translational vibrations in multiphase systems in microgravity conditions. Our aim is to mature this technology by acquiring the necessary knowledge for its use in space applications. In particular, the NASA ISS experiment Nucleate boiling in long-term cryogenic propellant storage in microgravity will benefit of the results obtained during the series of flights in the sRLV.'),(18,'Long duration manned spaceflight is constrained by the supplies required. Consumables such as food, breathing air and water have to be carried along. These supplies constitute a significant portion of the mission mass that has to be launched, and reducing the consumables required is a key area for game changing technologies that will enable manned deep space exploration. Several technologies have been under development to reclaim water in microgravity, with an emphasis on solutions that are lightweight and simplified enough to be robust for the space environment. One promising method is Vapor Phase Catalytic Ammonia Removal (VPCAR). The VPCAR technology recycles grey water (feed) to potable water via a combined distillation and high temperature catalytic vapor oxidation process. This process relies on a Wiped-Film Rotating-Disk (WFRD) to provide the evaporation and condensation surfaces that make distillation possible in a range of gravitational fields from lunar to zero-g.'),(43,'The lack of the gravity-driven gas-liquid phase separation in microgravity has severely compromised a wide range of space technologies, ranging from liquid pumps to volumetric techniques for sampling liquids and to electrolytic oxygen generators. Even the removal of bubbles growing on surfaces in contact with a liquid presents a challenge in microgravity. Unexpectedly, while carrying out experiments on polarized suspensions in microgravity aboard the NASA aircraft in 2003, we observed the appearance of a gas-liquid phase separation caused by the application of high-gradient electric fields. Based on these observations and supported by a NASA grant, we developed a novel method for the field and flow driven concentration and removal of air bubbles from fluids in microgravity. The proposed method is based on the discovery of collective electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) phenomena in ensemble of bubbles driven by the interplay of electric and hydrodynamic forces.'),(46,'Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) are the highest clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere, 83 km (50 miles), near the edge of space, and are observed slightly below the mesopause in the polar summertime. These clouds are of special interest as they are sensitive to both global climate change and to solar/terrestrial influences, i.e. the coupling between the heliosphere and the Earth\'s atmosphere. The first recorded sightings of PMCs were reported in 1885 at high latitudes and were recognizable because they were of such altitude as to still reflect sunlight after the sun had set, thus giving the appearance of glowing at night, hence the term noctilucent (‘night-glowing’) clouds. The objective of this flight experiment is to observe and analyze, for the first time, stabilized imagery of very high resolution in proximity to PMC cloud layers. Tomography of PMC formations may then be obtained to a precision previously unobtainable.'),(41,'As space missions increase in scope, size, complexity and duration, so do both power and heat dissipation demands. This is particularly the case for future manned missions to Mars. Paramount to the success of these missions is the ability to reduce size and weight, including those of thermal management sub-systems. Based on NASA/TM-2004-212940 (Workshop on Critical Issues in Microgravity Fluids, Transport, and Reaction Processes in Advanced Human Support Technology) in the focus area of Thermal Systems and Phase Change Processes, there is a need for improved energy-to-mass ratios, which suggests replacing present single-phase operations with two-phase systems. The transition from single-phase to two-phase thermal management can yield orders of magnitude enhancement in evaporation and condensation heat transfer coefficients. '),(38,'A significant step in addressing safety of commercial space vehicles is development and testing the flight information recorder or “black box”. It is envisioned, that Structural Health Monitoring system (SHM) would be an integral part of the “black box” and would record information on structural integrity during all stages of spaceflight. Consideration of SHM data is useful in pre-flight diagnostics, in-orbit operation and tuning, and in analysis of structural behavior (or disintegration) during spacecraft reentry. SHM information would also play a prominent role in space vehicle re-certification for the next flight. This project discusses experiments and associated hardware for a prototype structural health monitoring system intended to be integrated with a future “black box”, tested separately in balloon and/or suborbital flight.'),(42,'Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) is partnered with Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the University of Arizona for the New Frontiers III OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security Regolith Explorer) mission. OSIRIS-REx will collect a sample of an asteroid with a gas fluidization approach.'),(48,'Both hardware and protocol improvements are being investigated for the promising application of Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in flight situations in order to assess whether or not a crew member’s cognitive awareness has been impaired. fNIRS is an emerging technique which indirectly measures neuronal activity in the cortex via neurovascular coupling: neurovascular activity is a direct indicator of cognitive state. It is non-invasive, relatively portable, inexpensive, and safe for long-term monitoring and repeated measurements. fNIRS exploits the principle that optical absorption changes with blood oxygenation levels through the hemodynamic response.'),(37,'Particulate materials constitute a large part of the natural world. At grand scales, these are the dusty nebulae clouds from which stars and planets are formed. At planetary scales, particulates constitute the rings of the giant planets, global dust storms on Mars and volcanic ash plumes on Earth. Particulate materials also make up the regoliths, soils, and sediments of solar system bodies. On Earth, they form the reservoirs for water, gas, and oil. Many scientific disciplines, engineering applications, and industrial pursuits involve the study or handling of particulate matter occurring in the form of powders and granules. In most cases, there is a need to be able to predict the behavior of these materials, and this in turn requires knowledge of the fundamental physics that causes particles to attract or repel one another. We will study these particulate materials while they are freely suspended and dispersed in reduced gravity in order to unmask weak forces.'),(49,'The ability to provide healthcare delivery during expeditionary spaceflight and operations on the surface of the Moon or Mars includes the capability of conducting fundamental surgical procedures. In these microgravity (μ-G) or partial gravity working environments, control and containment of the surgical operative site is required to prevent cabin contamination, maintain acceptable visualization of the surgical field, avoid gaseous embolization in the patient, and control bleeding. To address these requirements, a hermetic surgery system (HeSS) is being jointly developed by Dr. George Pantalos (University of Louisville) and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University. The HeSS creates a hermetically sealed surgical field that controls and staunches bleeding during surgery by isolating the wound and creating an aqueous environment within the surgical field while leveraging current single incision laparoscopic surgical (SILS) techniques and instruments in clinical use.'),(8,'In order to provide safe and sustainable breathable air aboard crewed space vehicles and extraterrestrial or planetary outposts, dust mitigation techniques appropriate for space environments must be developed. Filtering of airborne particles under these environmental constraints and conditions poses unique challenges. Filtration systems not only need to remove fine particles such as skin flakes, hair and clothing fibers, and other particulate matter from food and hygiene operations, they must also remove any extra-terrestrial planetary dust tracked into the habitat by the crew returning from exploration as well as debris from operating machinery and equipment. Thus the system must be capable of filtering particles sizes spread over several orders of magnitude. Further, since servicing or replacing filters in space is not a trivial task, the system is also required to last extraordinary life times.'),(35,'The extension of human space exploration from a low earth orbit to a high earth orbit, then to Moon, Mars, and possibly asteroids and moons of other planets is one of NASA’s biggest challenges for the new millennium. Integral to this is the effective, affordable, and reliable supply of cryogenic fluids. The efficient and safe utilization of cryogenic fluids in thermal management, power and propulsion, and life support systems of a spacecraft during space missions involves the transport, handling, and storage of these fluids in terrestrial, reduced gravity and near-zero gravity conditions.'),(9,'The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, in partnership with West Virginia University, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and Yaskawa America, Inc., intends to conduct autonomous robotic capture demonstrations in a near-zero gravity environment on an airplane. The proposed experiment will help answer some of the technical challenges identified in NASA’s Office of the Chief Technologist Robotics, Tele-Robotics, and Autonomous Systems Roadmap. Such a platform can be used to support development and validation of technology required for future missions such as GEO capture and refuel of satellites, Hubble Space Telescope Deorbit, Near Earth Asteroid Robotic Precursor, and the Near Earth Asteroid Human Mission.'),(15,'We will demonstrate an instrument suite consisting of modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) electric field mill and magnetometer sensors for observing the electromagnetic (EM) environment inside and in the vicinity of suborbital reusable launch vehicles. The initial objective of this experiment is to characterize the electromagnetic field environment inside the spacecraft to understand the potential effects of strong external and internally generated fields on the spacecraft and payloads. Such initial experiments will also demonstrate the feasibility of making future global electric circuit measurements on a routine basis to assess the influence of global change on the Earth’s complex electrical environment.'),(16,'Draper proposes the Planetary Landing Exploration Technology (PLANET) Project to mature cross-cutting Precision Landing Autonomous Guidance, Navigation and Control (AGNC) technology. PLANET will leverage mature AGNC technology and flight proven hardware to provide cost-effective, safe closed-loop sRLV flight demonstration of Precision Landing AGNC. The demonstration results provide risk reduction of the application of precision landing and hazard avoidance to a broad range of future NASA missions and technology demonstration projects. In addition to maturing the Precision Landing AGNC technology, the project proposes to extend the capabilities of the sRLV vehicles and enable future technology demonstrations.'),(17,'Due to current industry trends in electronics component design and packaging, spacecraft are becoming smaller and more powerful. As a result, spacecraft power densities are foreseen to increase dramatically in the coming years, and thermal considerations are expected to become an even larger problem than on current spacecraft. Today’s thermal control technologies will soon be too inefficient or ineffective to meet tomorrow’s needs, and innovative thermal management solutions are required to ensure that thermal considerations do not limit spacecraft capabilities on future missions. This project presents a revolutionary new thermal control solution in development at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate, called IsoTherm, which provides a 100X increase in thermal performance by integrating a two-phase (liquid/vapor) cooling loop within the ribs of an isogrid structural panel, with no detrimental effect on the stiffness/mass ratio of the panel. The objective of our experiment is to quantify the performance of the IsoTherm system, and the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps that power it, in a microgravity environment.'),(22,'This Technology is an evolution from <a href=\"/technologies/15/\">Technology #15: Electromagnetic Field Measurements on sRLV</a>. We propose to improve our initial instrument suite design consisting of modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) electric field mill and magnetometer sensors by addition of a dual frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with inertial measurement unit (IMU). The initial experiments will demonstrate the feasibility of making future global electric circuit and water vapor/ionospheric profile measurements on a routine basis to assess the influence of global change on the Earth’s complex electrical environment.'),(23,'Next generation suborbital vehicles will provide an innovative platform for the characterization of atmospheric absorption and emission profiles within the Earth\'s mesosphere at altitudes of up to 300,000 feet. With considerable existing data on the infrared background at stratospheric altitudes, the need to characterize absorption and emission features in the mesosphere becomes apparent. The measurements envisioned are designed to guide astronomers in the selection of required altitudes for infrared observations at altitudes above those of airborne or balloon-based experiments. Although suborbital flights are currently limited in duration, some astronomical observations are transient in nature and may benefit from the unique capabilities offered by the latest suborbital vehicles.'),(24,'This technology is an evolution from <a href=\"/technologies/7\">Technology #7: Radio Frequency Mass Gauge on Parabolic</a>. Here, the objective is to gauge the liquid oxygen tank of the Masten Space Systems <a href=\"/platforms/suborbital/xaero\">Xaero suborbital Reusable Launch Vehicle (sRLV)</a> by installing an antenna inside the tank on a tube assembly and collecting data with RFMG electronics mounted in the payload area during the sRLV flight. After the flight, the RF gauging data will be compared to Masten\'s own measurement or estimate of liquid quantity during the flight. A minimum of one flight test is requested, but we prefer to fly the small payload on as many subsequent flights as possible to gain a maximum return on investment.'),(28,'Programs to monitor the health and wellness of NASA’s first astronauts drove the early development of technology for monitoring human physiology. The commercial evolution of these early physiologic sensors has since transformed clinical health care in terrestrial operating rooms, emergency departments, and cardiac care units. NASA programs for Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems (TA06) are likely to benefit from highly leveraged commercial biosensor development and integration.The Vital Space effort is focused on the development and implementation of cost effective, innovative hardware and software solutions for the collection, storage, and retrieval of physiological data related to the training, in-flight, and post-flight performance of commercial spaceflight participants.'),(29,'The presence of dust on the surfaces of solar system bodies raises several technical issues related to unmanned and manned exploration of the solar system. Fine grains may damage optical instruments, coat solar panels, or jam moving parts on spacecraft. Particles that enter astronaut habitats can pose a further health hazard through inhalation or contamination of seals or other equipment. Understanding the behavior of fine particles in dusty environments in response to human and robotic activities is crucial to the success of exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and especially to small bodies such as asteroids with negligible surface gravity. A broad set of experimental data in the reduced-gravity regime in which these collisions occur is necessary to interpret the existing and ever-growing volume of data on dust in planetary systems.'),(30,'Numerous long duration International Space Station crewmembers have developed visual changes and symptoms consistent with an increase in pressure around the brain. The cause of these changes is not known, and efforts to develop techniques to measure the pressure in the eye and brain would provide an important tool to monitor crew health. This proposal will investigate 3 fully developed prototype devices in a microgravity environment to assess the usability, functionality, and human factors modifications required to allow these devices to be integrated into ISS medical care. These experiments will allow thoughtful selection of the next generation of medical devices for eye and neurologic care to be rapidly transitioned to spaceflight.'),(31,'One of the key questions that remains unanswered as we prepare to send humans to other planetary surfaces is the degree to which living and exercising in these reduced gravity environments will provide an osteo-protective stimulus to prevent the loss of bone mineral density (BMD) that has been observed in microgravity. As a primary endpoint of the NSBRI-funded ‘Monitoring Bone Health by Daily Load Stimulus during Lunar Missions’ project, a small, wireless activity monitoring system has been developed to monitor the mechanical stimulus delivered to the lower extremity during complete days of activity during space missions in a pre-emptive approach to bone health maintenance. A dedicated parabolic flight study of locomotor activity and functional tasks similar to those conducted in our ground-based studies will aid in flight-readiness reviews and help validate the system for use in microgravity, possibly aboard the ISS.'),(34,'Draper\'s Vision Navigation System (VNS) Project aims to mature cross-cutting Precision Planetary Landing Navigation technology to TRL 6 through Flight Demonstrations. Key benefits of the project are: (1) maturing cross-cutting vision navigation applicable to a range of future missions, (2) extending the capability and flight envelope of flight opportunities vehicles, (3) providing capability that can be leveraged for future OCT demonstrations, and (4) enables future autonomous landing and hazard avoidance system demonstrations. VNS will leverage TRL6 AGNC (Autonomous Guidance, Navigation & Control) technology and flight proven hardware to provide cost-effective, safe sRLV flight demonstration of a vision navigation system appropriate for planetary landing navigation and hazard detection systems. The demonstration results provide risk reduction of the application of precision landing and hazard avoidance to a broad range of future NASA missions and technology demonstration projects.'),(36,'Understanding the behavior of fine particles in dusty environments in response to human and robotic activities is crucial to the success of exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and especially to small bodies such as asteroids with negligible surface gravity. We propose to perform a low-energy impact experiment to be carried out in a zero-gravity environment using a commercial suborbital vehicle. The experiment is a modified version of the Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) that was flown previously on two space shuttle missions. Modifications to the experiment include individualized vacuum chambers and higher quality video data. The experiment has also been modified for autonomous operation on a commercial suborbital vehicle.'),(39,'Current state-of-the-art methods of mass gauging of cryogenic liquids in microgravity conditions are based on the global behavior of the storage tank and do not take into account random fuel distribution. Under NASA\'s IPP program, NASA GSFC engineers have developed and tested a proximity/near field noninvasive sensor which allows performing reliable and robust method of mass gauging of fuel stored in a tank subjected to zero/microgravity environment. This project intends to use the zero-G environment provided by parabolic flights to test and advance this electrical capacitance volumetric tomography (ECVT) technology to measure mass of propellant fuel stored in a tank operating in a zero–G condition.'),(40,'This project supports the Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) Next Generation Life Support (NGLS) project which covers the development of the Forward Osmosis Secondary Treatment (FOST) technology. A key subsystem of the FOST is the Electrochemcial Ammonia Reduction (EAR) subsystem. Our aim is to achieve a risk mitigation microgravity evaluation and electrode design activity for EAR, which is a critical element of the FOST system.'),(44,'Purpose of the experiment is to study how the reduced gravity conditions influence the formation of the micro-structures in the sintering process of powder materials. Previous experiments on powder mixing and compacting have been carried out on parabolic flights, using ceramic-based composite materials with different percentages of alumina and zircon oxide, which showed that in the samples compressed under reduced gravity the distribution of the zircon in the alumina is more homogenous as compared to the samples obtained under 1 g on ground. This is due to the fact that the reduced gravity favors the formation of the mixing and the absence of powder sedimentation. The proposed experiment will extend this investigation, by heating pre-compressed samples to sintering temperature, under the reduced gravity conditions provided by a parabolic flight aircraft.'),(45,'The accumulation of trash from day-to-day activities of astronauts, while on long duration missions to explore our solar system, is bound to be a significant problem. It is imperative that we “close the loop” for human life support for these missions, and re-use as much of the trash as possible. Closing the Loop for Life Support was given very high priority in the recent NRC report. To that end, a project is funded to begin design and development of a Heat Melt Compactor (HMC). A Heat Melt Compactor is a device that will extract residual water from astronaut’s trash (e.g. wet wipes, juice boxes), and then compact the trash in a 10-to-1 ratio to provide easier storage and perhaps some usefulness as an ionizing radiation shield. For reference, commercial trash compactors use a 4-to-1 ratio.'),(47,'The Boston University student Satellite for Applications and Training (BUSAT) project is a hardware development program developing a scientific nanosatellite platform for future multi-mission use with a minimum of non-recurring engineering cost. The primary goal of the microgravity flight campaign is characterization and demonstration of the mechanical responsiveness of two key hardware components: a solar panel deployment system and an antenna array deployment system. In doing so, BUSAT intends to create standardized, low-cost, and reliable nano- and pico-satellite mechanical bus subsystems for future use by defense, civilian and academic spaceflight projects.'),(50,'The recent SUNRISE balloon mission carried a Shack-Hartmann array on its one meter telescope to quantitatively measure the atmospheric-induced wavefront errors in the stratospheric balloon environment. The results of that experiment were identical to an instrument flying in space, i.e., at the SUNRISE float altitude (near 120,000 ft), no wavefront errors were detected. The implications are momentous: a stratospheric balloon-borne telescope is sufficiently high (above 99.5% of the atmosphere) that it performs at the diffraction limit. The Hubble Space Telescope is currently the only facility that can produce images at 0.1 arc second resolution or better at visible wavelengths, but 1 and 2 meter balloon-borne telescopes will have this capability. We intend to fly a series of two stratospheric flights on NSC balloons to demonstrate a diffraction-limited imaging system from the relatively low-cost platform of a balloon at 30.5 km altitude.'),(51,'Microgravity-induced changes in cardiovascular physiology are well-known and significant. Even short duration flights can lead to orthostatic intolerance, syncope, and reduced maximal oxygen uptake upon return to earth. In long-duration spaceflights, these effects can lead to the incapacity to egress the re-entry vehicle without help. Countermeasures, such as exercise or low body negative pressure application, are typically used to mitigate these effects. However, there is still a need for a simple method to monitor and quantify the cardiac de-compensation and the effectiveness of the counter-measures, as shown in the NASA Bioastronautics Roadmap.'),(52,'Missions to asteroids pose technical challenges unlike those to larger bodies. Dusty regolith under extreme low gravity creates conditions where contact with the surface by manned or unmanned missions stir up dust that may hamper the mission objectives. Also, regolith collection for the purpose of sample return or in-situ analysis may be achieved by a variety of different mechanical designs of a collector mechanism. Both the performance of the collecting mechanism as well as the dust kicked up by contact of the mechanism with the surface needs to be tested under microgravity conditions. Regolith in Earth-based laboratories behaves differently than under microgravity conditions. We intend to test a dusty regolith retrieval mechanism in microgravity conditions on a sub-orbital rocket in order to characterize the issues associated with activities on an asteroid.');

The agency also is requesting information from commercial suborbital reusable launch vehicle providers and commercial payload integrators about carrying the technology payloads. \r\n\r\nThe selected payloads will fly on aircraft that provide parabolic flight trajectories and on suborbital reusable launch vehicles capable of flying to altitudes above 62 miles. The flights will expose the payloads to reduced gravity and near-zero gravity environments. \r\n\r\n\"During these flights, researchers will be able to test their technologies in a range of microgravity environments and share their data with NASA -- data NASA can use when planning future missions,\" said Bobby Braun, NASA chief technologist at the agency\'s headquarters in Washington. \r\n\r\nThe solicitation is being made by NASA\'s Flight Opportunities Program, which is designed to foster development of a commercial reusable suborbital transportation industry while developing new technologies and improving microgravity research. When available, such reusable vehicles will provide lower-cost, more frequent, and more reliable access to space. \r\n\r\nTechnology flights are expected to reduce risks associated with emerging technologies and procedures, and overall space operations in future missions, by demonstrating applications in a relevant environment. \r\n\r\nThe solicitation for suborbital flights is open until Dec. 31, 2014. Applications for the first round of flights are due by Jan. 31, 2011. Responses to the request for information about services of commercial suborbital reusable launch vehicle providers are due Jan. 20, 2011. Participation in both activities is open to all categories of organizations. \r\n\r\nThe Flight Opportunities Program, part of NASA\'s Office of the Chief Technologist, integrates the existing Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research and Facilitated Access to the Space Environment for Technology programs.

The awards will allow the two companies to perform test flights of their experimental vehicles near the edge of space. </p>\r\n<p>The flights will demonstrate the capabilities of new vehicles to provide recoverable launch and testing of small payloads going to \"near-space,\" the region of Earth\'s atmosphere between 65,000 and 350,000 feet. The CRuSR program fosters the development of commercial reusable transportation to near space. The overall goal of the program is regular, frequent and predictable access to near-space at a reasonable cost with easy recovery of intact payloads. </p>\r\n<p>\"These two awards are just the beginning of an innovative teaming relationship with industry to provide affordable access to the edge of space while evaluating the microgravity environment for future science and technology experiments,\" said NASA Chief Technologist Bobby Braun at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"CRuSR represents the sort of government-commercial partnership that will facilitate near-space access at affordable costs.\" </p>\r\n<p>The CRuSR awards will fund two flights this fall and one this winter of Armadillo\'s Super-Mod vehicle from Spaceport America in New Mexico. The first two flights will be to an altitude of approximately nine miles and the third to approximately 25 miles. </p>\r\n<p>The Masten Space Systems\' Xaero vehicle will make four flights this winter from the Mojave Spaceport in California. Two flights will reach an altitude of approximately three miles and two others will be to approximately 18 miles, with an engine shutdown during flight. </p>\r\n<p>Both launch vehicles will be modified to mount three antennas for the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) payload. ADS-B-equipped vehicles can determine their position using global navigation satellite systems. The vehicles can periodically broadcast position data and other relevant information to ground stations and other similarly equipped aircraft. </p>\r\n<p>In NASA\'s fiscal 2011 Space Technology Program, CRuSR will become an integral part of the Flight Opportunities Program within the Office of the Chief Technologist. </p>\r\n<p>For more information on NASA\'s Flight Opportunities Program, vist: </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://go.usa.gov/csj\">http://go.usa.gov/csj</a></p>\r\n<p>For more information about NASA\'s CRuSR program, visit: </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://flightopportunities.nasa.gov\">http://flightopportunities.nasa.gov</a></p>\r\n<p>For more information about NASA\'s Office of the Chief Technologist, visit: </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/oct\">http://www.nasa.gov/oct</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>end -</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&#187; <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/aug/HQ_10-203_CRuSR_Awards.html\">Read more</a></p>','Just in:NASA Selects Two Firms for Experimental Space Vehicle Test FlightsWASHINGTON -- NASA\'s Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research Program (CRuSR) has awarded a total of approximately $475,000 to Armadillo Aerospace of Rockwall, Texas and Masten Space Systems of Mojave, Calif.

These two-year contracts, worth a combined total of $10 million, will allow NASA to draw from a pool of commercial space companies to deliver payload integration and flight services. The flights will carry a variety of payloads to help meet the agency\'s research and technology needs. \r\n\r\n\"Through this catalog approach, NASA is moving toward the goal of making frequent, low-cost access to near-space available to a wide range of engineers, scientists and technologists,\" said NASA Chief Technologist Bobby Braun at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The government\'s ability to open the suborbital research frontier to a broad community of innovators will enable maturation of the new technologies and capabilities needed for NASA\'s future missions in space.\" \r\n\r\nThe selected companies are:\r\n- Armadillo Aerospace, Heath, Texas\r\n- Near Space Corp., Tillamook, Ore.\r\n- Masten Space Systems, Mojave, Calif.\r\n- Up Aerospace Inc., Highlands Ranch, Colo.\r\n- Virgin Galactic, Mojave, Calif.\r\n- Whittinghill Aerospace LLC, Camarillo, Calif.\r\n- XCOR, Mojave, Calif.\r\n\r\nNASA\'s Office of the Chief Technologist is charged with maturing crosscutting technologies to flight readiness status for future space missions.

This region is very difficult to study and especially sample as it is too high for balloons and too low for satellite observations.  There are numerous unresolved scientific issues related to the MLT that we simply cannot currently address because of inadequate observational sampling.   Atmospheric observations from commercial suborbital vehicles would provide a new window on the MLT.\r\n \r\nThe design for all of the vehicles has not been completely finalized. This workshop will allow for an open discussion of platform capabilities vs. measurement needs, allowing for any potential design requests to be easily accommodated sooner rather than later.\r\n \r\nAgenda will include:\r\n \r\n1.)

The <a title=\"MIT Enterprise Forum\" href=\"http://www.mitef.org/s/1314/main.aspx?gid=5&amp;pgid=61\">MIT Enterprise Forum</a> is “a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the growth and success of high-tech entrepreneurial ventures by connecting ideas, technology and people.” </p><p>The VLab event was titled “<a title=\"Space Exploration: Not Just for Billionaires Anymore\" href=\"http://www.vlab.org/article.html?aid=423\">Space Exploration: Not Just for Billionaires Anymore</a>”. A well-attended 1-hour networking session preceded the 1.5 hour plenary session. The networking zone included a large lawn, some <a title=\"New Space exhibits\" href=\"http://www.aiaa-sf.org/techtalks/2011/1003.html\">New Space exhibits</a> (including a NASA ARC-linked PhoneSat), good food, iced beer and wine. I saw several familiar faces but many more new ones. Young entrepreneurs were everywhere. </p><p>The Moderator was A. Kollipara, Managing Partner of Earth2Orbit and a Strategic Consultant. The single presenter was R. Pournelle, Sr. VP of Business Development, Nanoracks. A three-person follow-on panel included: Will Pomerantz, VP Special Projects, Virgin Galactic; Bob Richards, Co-founder/CEO, Moon Express; and A. Tadros, VP Civil and DoD Business, Space Systems/Loral. <a title=\"Speaker profiles\" href=\"http://www.vlab.org/article.html?aid=423\">Profiles were provided for all</a>. </p><p>Kollipara noted that candidate VLab events are always pitched to management by a small team of members and in this case, it was a hard sell. But, as the arguments were strengthened the skeptics gradually became converts and the large turnout of about 400 people, confirmed the importance of this emerging entrepreneurial market.  He reviewed some of the space market elements such as; GPS, satellite TV and radio, greentech, biotech/pharmaceutical research, all with good linkage to Silicon Valley interests. He sees what he calls the “NASA Transition” to collaboration and partnering with the private sector as a critical inflection point. This is demonstrated in part by its innovative contract mechanisms that emphasize payment for spacecraft development milestones reached, and associated contracts for NASA cargo transport. It is clear that NASA really wants to procure commercial services. </p><p>Pournelle’s presentation focused on his company, Nanoracks LLC, that has developed common flight hardware and related services for support of research on the US National Laboratory portion of the International Space Station (ISS). The Nanorack system integrates a suite of standard “CubeLabs” (1 kg) in an ISS rack that provides power, data, environmental control for these small payloads that have been transported up/down by US Space Shuttles. With the termination of this US Program, transport will be via international cargo transport systems of various kinds. \r\n\r\nThey charge $30K for 30 days on the ISS per CubeLab unit, but several units can be combined for larger research projects, as needed. They have flown 27 units and have another 25 in the queue. They are collaborating with other entities who develop commercial instruments to work with CubeLabs and are proving a suite of small instrumentation that can be used by ISS crew to conduct onboard analysis of materials and bio-samples. They see themselves as partners with their customers in space research and provide a wide range of support services to them. </p><p>The 3-person panel, and Kollipara and Pournelle then participated in an extended Q&amp;A session. They provided answers to a list of pre-selected and audience-provided questions. Seven pre-selected questions (see VLab event link above) covered topics such as; “How can entrepreneurs successfully launch new ventures in the space industry?” and “How can a software entrepreneur take advantage of this new ecosystem?” </p><p>Bob Richards responded to an audience question for the panel, “Do you need NASA involvement?” His experience has been that even though NASA is obviously a large bureaucracy, good relationships generally prevail with the private sector. And there are many commercial space enthusiasts within its centers. NASA has identified and provided access to existing technology and resources that have potential lunar applications and have been invaluable to Moon Express. He sees NASA as a real asset to his company’s goals. </p>\r\n<p>Written by Richard Mains, Flight Opportunities Technology Liaison</p>','Written by Richard Mains, Flight Opportunities Technology Liaison The MIT/Stanford Venture Lab (VLab), a San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the MIT Enterprise Forum, met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, on September 20th.

It’s my second time doing so, and I’m still trying to grasp what makes the gathering so special to so many, including me.  It is sometimes referred to as the “Pat Hynes event” partly due to that easier-to-remember name, but I think that’s also a clue to its uniqueness.   Hynes’s ongoing role as ISPCS Chair ensures that the New Mexico state motto, “Land of Enchantment” is infused into the overall flavor of the event.  I think for her enchantment can help empower people to access what they need – something she hopes to accomplish by all her efforts.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hynes was instrumental in designing and developing the ISPCS with the aim to foster growth of commercial space enterprises and thereby provide lower-cost, more frequent and broader access to space.  Her base of operations for years has been at New Mexico State University (NMSU) where she is Director of the <a href=\"http://www.nmspacegrant.com/\">New Mexico Space Grant Consortium</a>. The ISPCS is just one of its many programs.  NSMU awarded her with undergrad (English), masters (Higher-Ed Management) and doctorate (Business Administration) degrees, which surely help her perform the many professional roles she plays, but always have a good story to tell.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quick look at <a href=\"http://www.patriciahynes.com/\">Pat Hynes’s web site</a>, provides insight to one of her visions that I paraphrase as “I want New Mexico State University (NMSU) in Las Cruces to be to commercial space enterprises, what Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA is to Silicon Valley’s digital design and development enterprises.”   That’s some vision, but she’s been working on it at least since 1991.   That’s when she and some fellow advocates determined that they wanted to establish a spaceport in the area.  The goal was to allow commercial “spaceliners” to fly people and cargo to space, similar to what airliners do from airports, and to bring the resulting benefits to New Mexico.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.patriciahynes.com/\"><img src=\"/media/uploads/blog/pathynes.jpg\" alt=\"Photo: Pat Hynes\" /></a><br />Pat Hynes (Photo: Pat Hynes)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty years of her efforts, with a large network of stakeholders, led to the dedication on October 16th of the first purpose-built U.S. spaceport.  It’s named “Spaceport America” (http://www.spaceportamerica.com/) and is just north of Las Cruces in the midst of nowhere, but conveniently adjacent to White Sands, a government test and missile range.   The main hangar facility at Spaceport America was dedicated as the “Virgin Galactic Gateway to Space” and Richard Branson, the company’s charismatic CEO, celebrated by rappelling down to the ground from the roof as he christened the structure using a large bottle of champagne. Virgin Galactic will be an anchor tenant and conduct regular suborbital flights to the edge of space within a few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.virgingalactic.com/multimedia/album/virgin-galactic-keys-to-a-new-dawn/\"><img src=\"/media/uploads/blog/spaceport-dedication_virgin-galactic.jpg\" alt=\"Photo: Virgin Galactic/Mark Greenberg\" /></a><br />Virgin Galactic Gateway to Space Dedication, Spaceport America, New Mexico, October 17, 2011. (Photo: Virgin Galactic/Mark Greenberg)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hynes noted in her introduction…“The focus of ISPCS is to provide you a snapshot of the Commercial Space industry...  Knowing where we are right now helps us plan the future.”  This year’s theme was “<a href=\"http://www.ispcs.com/program_2011.php\">Business at the Speed of Innovation</a>” and many of the key presentations are now <a href=\"http://www.ispcs.com/presentations_2011.php\">available online</a>. Perhaps the combination of Hynes’s guarantee that the annual event will include “enchantment”  (think “<a href=\"http://www.guykawasaki.com/enchantment/\">Changing Hearts, Minds and Actions</a>\" as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki\">Guy Kawasaki</a> puts it) mixed with many down-to-earth discussions about global commercial space business is what brings everyone back to Las Cruces. This includes NASA’s Deputy Administrator, the keynote speaker, Lori Garver, a regular attendee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hynes kicked off day one with an NMSU-provided three-student marimba band. Surely I was not the only one there wondering what she was up to. But, they performed an intriguing ethereal, semi-spacey composition with style and a bit of humor.  She explained that the students were there to help unite and focus us on our shared learning adventure, and it seemed to do just that. The attendees, as always, included many key US and foreign stakeholders (industry, government, academic, public enthusiasts, the press) in the evolving commercial space community.  Hynes works this community for months to create each year’s gathering and this year she added a major new exhibit space that was filled to capacity.&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hynes sees the ISPCS as a high-value discussion, collaboration and learning opportunity and to that end, schedules no parallel sessions so everyone becomes more enlightened together. There are generous breaks, leisurely onsite lunches under a large tent, small rooms to gather a few kindred souls together for exchanges, and at appropriate times, a free full bar with heavy snacks to encourage communication. This provides a convivial, relaxed environment that is rare at such events, and promotes honest, open exchanges.&#160;</p><p>Very much in the spirit of the ISPCS, the NASA <a href=\"https://flightopportunities.nasa.gov\">Flight Opportunities Program</a> (FOP), that I support, had its own event at a local restaurant on the last evening.  Key attendees included our <a href=\"/platforms\">commercial suborbital reusable launch vehicle providers</a>, some commercial payload integrators, and several key FOP staff.  A buffet dinner was followed by an informal exchange of ideas. The FOP research payload flow process was presented and the attendees provided feedback and introduced some new questions.  The event was an initial step in developing collaborations that will be essential to supporting the FOP goal of flying competitively selected research payloads “early, often, and safely” for a wide range of customers that will help advance technologies for future NASA missions and commercial benefit.    \r\nFor me, some take-home lessons from this Pat Hynes event and our own FOP gathering include the view that:</p><ul><li>Face-to-face discussion is essential for building collaborations</li><li>Being frank and open while learning can be inspiring</li><li>Gathering with those who share a vision builds determination and willingness to take risk</li><li>Networking in the high desert helps raise the level of trust</li></ul><br /><p>I think Pat Hynes’s annual event has some of the best elements of what some might call a “Commercial Space Camp”, since strong bonds develop between returning attendees.  It helps build a belief in the future and encourages them to continue taking the risks needed to bring commercial space to reality.  And, that’s pretty special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Written by Richard Mains, Flight Opportunities Technology Liaison</strong></p>\r\n','I recently attended the 7th annual International Symposium for Personal and Commercial Spaceflight (ISPCS) in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

The SL-6 launch is a mission by the <a href=\"http://ors.csd.disa.mil/\">Operationally Responsive Space Office</a> (ORS), but there was extra space available in the Nose Cone section of the vehicle that the Suborbital Flight Environment Monitor (SFEM) was able to occupy.

The UP aerospace facility is comprised of two trailers, a generator, quads and a port-a-potty. Each morning starts with a 08:00 daily briefing. This was the first morning the entire payload team(s) had arrived, so introductions were made and a safety briefing for the general area was provided; following this, an overview of the daily activities and integration flow were presented. The main activity for Monday was payload integration. Most of the payloads were ready for integration, except for the SFEM and the FAA’s ADS-B. The ADS-B needed to perform a functional test and the SFEM needed to charge/replace batteries and program the unit for flight.</p><p>The SFEM original programming protocol, for Masten and Armadillo, relied on very late access and was manually activated to start recording immediately prior to integration and required the flight to occur within the 4 hour limit of memory capacity. With the UP flight, integration occurs at L-3 days, so this protocol was not going to work with this vehicle. A new protocol using a time delayed start was created for this flight. Additionally, since the launch window is 5 hours, 07:00 – 12:00, and the SFEM can only record for 4 hours, a g trigger condition was also added to the protocol. A very low g trigger of 0.5 g was used so none of the launch profile will be missed. The new program was tested and worked successfully prior to the final programming for flight. Once the SFEM was prepared for flight it was inserted and bolted to the Nose Cone 3 section of the rocket. The nose cone was than placed in a crate and transported out to the launch pad for integration.</p><p><strong>Written by Karolyn Ronzano - Flight Opportunities Program Special Projects Lead</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Bringing the flight hardware to the integration facility\" title=\"Bringing the flight hardware to the integration facility\" src=\"/media/uploads/blog/carryingflightcase-620px.jpg\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Payload integration onto the vehicle\" title=\"Payload integration onto the vehicle\" src=\"/media/uploads/blog/integration-620px.jpg\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Nose Cone integration\" title=\"Nose Cone integration\" src=\"/media/uploads/blog/integrationofnosecone-620px.jpg\" /></p><p><img alt=\"SpaceLoft-6 Launch Pad\" title=\"SpaceLoft-6 Launch Pad\" src=\"/media/uploads/blog/launchpad2-620px.jpg\" /></p><p><img alt=\"SpaceLoft-6 Launch Pad\" title=\"SpaceLoft-6 Launch Pad\" src=\"/media/uploads/blog/launchpad.jpg\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Launch!\" title=\"Launch!\" src=\"/media/uploads/blog/launch-620px.jpg\" /></p>','The team flew in to Albuquerque Sunday evening and drove to Truth or Consequences in preparation to participate in the pre-launch activities for the UP Aerospace SpaceLoft-6 launch.&#160; The SL-6 launch is a&#160; mission by the Operationally Responsive Space Office (ORS), but there was extra space available in the Nose ...','SpaceLoft-6 \"UP Aerospace\" \"SpacePort America\"','spaceloft-6-flight-preparations-sfem',2,0,0,0,'2012-04-04 11:19:35','2012-04-05 09:57:14','2012-04-04 11:19:35','2042-03-15 00:00:00',0,'','zinnia/entry_detail.html'),(68,'NASA Space Technology Program’s Flight Opportunities Workshop at JPL','','<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm\"><img src=\"https://flightopportunities.nasa.gov/media/uploads/blog/jpl.jpg\" title=\"Jet Propulsion Laboratory\" /></a><p>The Flight Opportunities Program (FOP) has conducted three Workshops designed to introduce our flight opportunities for research payloads at annual <a href=\"http://nsrc.swri.org/\">Next-gen Suborbital Research Conferences</a> in 2010, 2011, and 2012 and a one-day <a href=\"https://flightopportunities.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/31/suborbital-research-stakeholders-gather-gsfc-workshop/\">Workshop at Goddard Space Research Center</a> in Fall 2011.</p><p>We recently completed a Workshop at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) hosted by Tom Cwik, Manager of the JPL NASA Technology Program Office and coordinated by Ross Jones, the Program Office Lead for Suborbital Research.

The Webinar “Workshop” will include more detailed descriptions of the current flight platform opportunities, an update on our solicitations, the FOP payload selection criteria, and information on the kinds of payloads that can be accommodated at this time. The Workshop goals are two-fold:</p><ul><li>help build a community of candidate researchers developing technologies suitable to propose and after selection fly as research payloads in flight-like environments (including to near-space with 3+ minutes of micro, lunar or Mars-g) to mature their technologies for potential future NASA applications</li><li>help stimulate the development of the commercial suborbital reusable vehicle industry. </li></ul><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The NASA Headquarters Office of the Chief Technologist’s (OCT) Space Technology Program contains several sub-programs. One is the FOP, which is managed from Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and for which ARC’s Dougal Maclise is the Payloads Manager. He is responsible for seeking out cutting-edge space technology payloads for flights on commercial reusable launch vehicles, balloons and a commercial parabolicaircraft. After hosting the earlier Webinar “Tour”, Dougal and Richard Mains, FOP Technology Liaison, will do so for this follow-on July 17th Workshop. This event is being supported by the office of the Ames Center Chief Technologist, headed by John Hines.</p>','Might your research payload successfully compete for a free parabolic or suborbital flight?
