issues:
    figuring out formset
    figuring out how to dynaimically add another formset
    figuring out how to process the formset
    figuring out how to process multiple forms on one view

    figuring out how to wrap the class template's formset's form's options' choices in a custom class tag so javascript can overwrite it when it is necessary such as when the form type changes


    couldnt figure out why it was breaking for empty forms.....spelling error

    figuring how to dynamically change form choices and modify the choices based on field type. 
    figuring how to save the form when the form changes type since each type has a different set of forms, for some reason, the form it validate against is not on the fly but pre rendered choices. Have to load a default form for django but render a different form in the template based on the initial type
    figuring how to save fk class name when changing an existing field form. 
    figuring how to save the checked selections and display the check selections correctly since the actual options is being loaded by template tags.

notes:
    assumes all classes created are presented at the root level
    thought about using ajax to do the form changes but it might be better suited for version 2 when most of the project is complete and looking forward to upgrade/update the project. since the initial goal is to complete the project.


duplicates for form names are automatically removed during save. issue is when 2 new entries with the same name, it creates error of duplicate entries in db so only save one solves the issue, and remove any complications. if users adds only one duplicate entry of an already existing, it will throw an error.
